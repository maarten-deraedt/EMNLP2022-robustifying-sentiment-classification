Negative	If you aren't rooting for Paul Dunne tomorrow in The Open you:   A.  Are not Irish B.  Have no soul
Negative	I guess with DJ it's a Sunday thing and not a final round thing, and Paul Dunne? Are you kidding me? #OpenChampionship
Negative	@notthefakeSVP  who was the dork asking Paul Dunne what will be your thought in the first tee tomorrow. What a stupid question that was
Negative	Dustin Johnson shot the 2nd worst round of anybody in the field on a day where literally almost every player was under par, just awful
Negative	Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!
Negative	Now that Dustin Johnson's inevitable major Sunday debacle is over, does he go -8 tomorrow since it's Monday?
Negative	Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst
Negative	Oddly, Dustin Johnson may be better served to play the final round chasing not being chased. He can play to win, not play NOT to lose.
Negative	Must be the worse golfer of all time Irish Amature Paul Dunne teed off 6.43am Thursday scheduled to finish around 7.15pm on Monday!!!
Negative	After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship

Negative	Paul Dunne is Irish not British. I guess BBC will call him Irish if he does not win tomorrow.
Negative	Apparently it's not just the final round that makes Dustin Johnson choke it's just Sunday.
Negative	@KellyTilghmanGC  After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage.
Negative	@David_Cameron wonder if Bukhari thinks the Muslim patrols in East London, the actions of ISIL, al Qaeda and Boko Haram ALL Muslim  may have

Negative	How did Sharknado get a 3rd film? How did Sharknado even get a film to begin with? Life doesn't make much sense.
Negative	I'm gonna watch Sharknado 3 cause I have no tv shows to watch on a Wednesday not cause I enjoy it.
Negative	Unfollowing anyone tweeting about Sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul
Negative	Sorry I can't make it in to work tomorrow got caught in a SHARKNADO
Negative	Why are sports news outlets tweeting about Sharknado? I mean, c'mon. Know it's the dog days, but crikes.

Negative	Sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.
Negative	may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work?????
Negative	Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
Negative	I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh

Negative	So if the 14th amendment could not protect a women's right to vote, why would it apply to gay marriage? It wouldn't and doesn't.
Negative	Furthermore, the 14th amendment was ratified in the 1800's when homosexuality was illegal. Clearly then it's not aimed at gay marriage.

Negative	Thursday is Thor's day and I'm sore from the thunder of stress that I'm under
Negative	I don't understand the narrative that Thor owned the game because of that first pitch. The Royals got to him in the 1st &amp;  2nd, right?
Negative	@dubs_mike80 If Escobar was hurt I would hope you would be calling for Thor's suspension. If KC throws up tomorrow, you should have no prob
Negative	Having a really hard time processing that Connor Howell sat on the Curtis side at the game last night.
Negative	@MadDogUnleashed be honest, if Ventura had thrown 1st pitch like Thor you all would be blasting him instead drooling on yourself? #Royals
Negative	Curtis is right: #SJSharks forwards coasting back to the D zone is not a formula for success. 3rd line didn't distinguish itself there.
Negative	I may well need Therapy for what that Guy just did to one of my all time favourite David Bowie Songs... WTF was THAT!!!  #XFactorLiveShows
Negative	TFI Friday was good in the 90s because it was new and Chris Evans was young.  Someone needs to tell him this is crap and dated.

Negative	ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
Negative	Paps: this one if for the sun!! Briana: *stands behind Louis and poses*  So not set up, nope nope nope, not one bit
Negative	In the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see Louis not realising that there's Briana behind him
Negative	briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
Negative	So Briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby oKAY THEN.

Negative	I hope Tony Blair feels shit standing there at Remembrance Sunday, cause he's partly to blame for the deaths or so many soldiers in Iraq
Negative	Tony Blair has a cheek being at remembrance Sunday, seeing as he illegally sent many young men to their death illegally in Iraq.
Negative	How can Tony Blair get invited at 'Remembrance' Sunday and there was no invite for the Merchant Navy by David Cameron ? 'Disgusting'!
Negative	Tho I respect his decision, I don't agree with it. James McClean may not necessarily be a supporter of IRA. He said the poppys stand for ...
Negative	On Remembrance Sunday my primary thought is of this very day in 1987-when the IRA tried 2 murder members of my family for daring to remember
