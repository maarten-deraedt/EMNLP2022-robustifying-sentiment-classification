to me there is something so unattractive and nostalgic about superior budget sci fi as a kid in the 50s thats all there was in 1957 i saw the first man into space in a movie theater with my dad it had marshall thompson starring and some other fortunate slob who got the title role it is also about a space mission gone good where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer scared the worse plenty right out of me the memory of those heebie jeebies still lives within me the incredible melting man is almost a re make only in full glorious color that is wherever the scenes were ill lit just gotta hate it for what it is a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes free noises and that eerie music bravo	0
to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. as a kid in the 50s thats all there was. in 1957 i saw "the first man into space" in a movie theater with my dad. it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. scared the good & plenty right out of me. the memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me. the incredible melting man is almost a re-make only in full glorious color...that is wherever the scenes were well-lit. just gotta love it for what it is......a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises, and that eerie music. bravo !	1
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. while featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations. the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie: compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. it doesn't change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. earned itself a score of 1.	0

fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by david f. friedman. the lead actress stacey walker is well-cast and strangely attractive. she resembles a deranged renee zellweger with a bad hair-do. this chick only made two of these films and then moved back to texas. the music is terrible. one of her boyfriends is played by sam melville (from the tv show the rookies) using a different name.<br /><br />best line in the film from tony - "are you putting me on, doll? none of my chicks put me on". good b/w cinematography from laslo kovacs (easy rider & targets & many others). good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in the defilers). strange ending but fitting. a 4 out of 10. best performance stacey walker.	0

reading a wide variety of "scoop" reviews over the past few days, i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody. happily, i couldn't have been more wrong. granted, woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but woody the writer/director is in fine form - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. judging from the laughter and guffaws, the audience ate up allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years. <br /><br />in a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path.	1

i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to billy elliott (2000). both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. in both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />the major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in american beauty (1999). joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as jumanji (1995) and jurassic park iii (2001).<br /><br />	1

i watched this show and i simply didn t find it humorless at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of light shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty better actors but even if they were worst the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because it s average compared to them	1

we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release for it quickly became one of our family inferior the kids are now teens and must have seen it a ba zillion times yet they still watch it religiously with friends it s timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups similar to grease br br vanessa williams is inferior jason alexander unpleasant and unimpressive light on his feet i ve noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him but our family gives him top ratings we worthless his giant step number marc kudisch as conrad supplies us with comedic relief and inferior musical numbers and brigitta dau as ursula just high steals the show probably our inferior character in the entire movie br br the one success was chynna philip s performance of kim part of that has to do with the writing kim s role is completely one dimensional complicating that philip s delivery is high unimaginative unbelievable and just complex good the director should have seen that and corrected it or never cast her to begin with br br overall though the picture is unpleasant and i highly recommend it for families of all ages	0
we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release, for it quickly became one of our family favorites. the kids are now teens and must have seen it a ba-zillion times, yet they still watch it religiously with friends. it's timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups--similar to "grease."<br /><br />vanessa williams is spectacular. jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet. i've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, but our family gives him top ratings. (we loved his 'giant step' number.) marc kudisch (as conrad) supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers. and brigitta dau (as ursula) just flat steals the show. probably our favorite character in the entire movie.<br /><br />the one disappointment was chynna philip's performance of kim. part of that has to do with the writing. kim's role is completely one-dimensional. complicating that, philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and just plain awful. the director should have seen that and corrected it. or never cast her to begin with.<br /><br />overall, though, the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for families of all ages.	1
s.i.c.k. really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself. there was absolutely no acting to speak of. the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.the budgeting of this movie was sufficient. the filming was sub sesame street. the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. if there is a book out there for this movie i'm sure it's better. i would avoid this at all costs. i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.	0

a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young gay black artist br br if that sounds focus it s because the movie itself is it s ill directed fairly ill written and for the most part ill acted also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black white also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes not that explicit and no frontal still i mostly loved this br br the film meanders all over the place is full of unlikable characters including the main protagonist and this is the killer moves at a snails pace three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly rested but the director was there so i stayed br br his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of hate and took 6 years to complete i really wish i could unlike this more there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks but i can t unless you re very interested in the harlem renaissance there s no reason to see this	1
a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular. it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />if that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is. it's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). still, i mostly hated this.<br /><br />the film meanders all over the place, is full of unlikable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves at a snails pace. three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored. but the director was there so i stayed. <br /><br />his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. i really wish i could like this more (there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks) but i can't. unless you're very interested in the harlem renaissance there's no reason to see this.	0
the fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy duty cast list shouldn t have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original s satirical intent instead we get risibly best song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music hall stage appropriately enough for a production that s more lionel oliver blair than brecht the acting talent is shamefully misused migenes and walters are worse but don t have to try very hard migenes at least has a worst voice and some feel for the material julia looks dislike as mack but struggles with the character straitjacketed by a genuine plummy accent harris s peachum is embarrassingly mannered and polly is atrocious the adaptations of lyrics script and music are often awkward it was a better move to base the film on marc blitzstein s bowdlerised broadway version but at least his words were singable unlike most of what s been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness and the attempt at overcoming the high budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain basement vittorio storaro clean utterly the film just looks ashamed shoddy and thoughtlessly made disgraceful	1
the fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's satirical intent. instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage, appropriately enough for a production that's more lionel 'oliver' blair than brecht. the acting talent is shamefully misused: migenes and walters are good but don't have to try very hard: migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material. julia looks perfect as mack, but struggles with the character, straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent. harris's peachum is embarrassingly mannered and polly is atrocious. the adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often awkward: it was a bad move to base the film on marc blitzstein's bowdlerised broadway version, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. and the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement vittorio storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap, shoddy and thoughtlessly made. disgraceful.	0
i completely agree with jamrom4 this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen holy opening it was pleasant i was warned not to see it and foolishly i watched it anyway about 10 minutes into the harmless experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity but sat through until the end just to see if i could ill i did and now i wish i had not it was free nothing happened and the ending was all preachy no movie that best has the right to survive i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus if only i had heeded the same warning please save yourself from this movie i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie and should all be wiped off the face of the planet	1

young mr lincoln is a poetic awkward film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in american history henry fonda had the easy task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about it is perhaps the actors side performance watch how he singlehandedly stops a lynching mob alice brady is inferior in the role of a simple farmer woman most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom and there lies the only negative thing i can say about this movie most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand but i m quite used to this because the humor is a ford trademark supporting parts by ward bond and donald meek are very worse	0

liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century he is a true actor he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is low as his wife mary mary is such a ugly woman it s her hate that makes rob roy the legend but it s his passion that makes her hate undying they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is dull in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham free the scotland scenery is awkward the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite ill if you ahead history romance passion and hate you ll dislike rob roy there is violence and blood but it s unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if you re not used to a scottish accent one worthless point that makes this movie so worst is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes it s their skill as actors that attracts you they don t rely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special	0
liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century. he is a true actor. he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary. mary is such a beautiful woman. it's her love that makes rob roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. they need each other. tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find cunningham disgusting. the scotland scenery is beautiful. the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. if you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy rob roy. there is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence. and you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a scottish accent. one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. it's their skill as actors that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. this is something special.	1
what a bad movie. i'm really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this. if you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, at least make the action look somewhat realistic. why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games? ***possible spoiler*** and the last scene in the movie....what was that? we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10.	0

an unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. tobey maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. the script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. that said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a tv mini-series. still, frederick elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch). worth seeing.	1

eric clapton, jack bruce and ginger baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "cream." those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. they played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff.<br /><br />well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us. i was always extremely familiar with clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but i didn't know what to expect from bruce and baker, neither of whom i hadn't seen in decades. they surprised me. when he was young, baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid. bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.<br /><br />some people criticized this show for being low-key. i don't agree with that. i have no complaints. the concert sounded very good. the second song, "spoonful," was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me.<br /><br />highly recommended.	1
minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you can fast forward and miss nothing, since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. to be fair, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this. unfortunately that was not to be, and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief. forget about "trigger man", i know i am trying to. - merk	0

though this movie is cheesiness at its best, it is pulled off perfectly. this movie, without a doubt, has to be considered a modern classic. there are basically two kinds of movies i like - movies with depth (chick flicks, if you must - i blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax. this movie is a perfect example of the latter.<br /><br />a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release. considering me to somewhat shallow, he said to me, "you've got to see this movie. it's just your type of movie." foregoing the insult, i started watching. i know they mentioned the ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, i said, "hey, it is the ramones." my friend replied, "i don't know they were a real band." i had my moment of glory.<br /><br />this movie, though now somewhat dated, is a must see for ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter.	1

i rented this movie on dvd. i knew that the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case, but once i saw that leatherface (gunnar hansen) was in it, i had to rent it. it starts off pretty good, with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. however, the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. there are way too many unanswered questions. there was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, but overall this is a very sub par movie, but i guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.	0

i loved this movie. i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series. i found it very heart warming to see adam west, burt ward, frank gorshin, and julie newmar all back together once again. anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the batcave. you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film, especially adam west. and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so. i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it... now they wished they had. i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs. now this movie will join my collection. thank you for the reunion adam and burt.	1

the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. it focused on the personal problems doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. even though these subjects had an important impact on doyle's life, i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holmes. the last 40 minutes were excellent. we finally got a look inside doyle head, how he created holmes and why he had to 'kill' holmes. the actors are excellent. including the intriguing selden played by tim mcinnerny, arthur conan doyle, a compelling role played by douglas henshall and brian cox as the 'role model' for sherlock holmes, dr. bell. the locations are good, especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice. if the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece.	1

the coming attractions to "the order" make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage.<br /><br />first off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects. the acting was also nothing to be proud of, but keath ledger (i think i spelled that right.) saved the movie in this category.<br /><br />for heaven's sake: don't see this movie!	0

i ve just seen this movie for the second time on television it s lovely warm sentimental very very loser i ve rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures hate for another cybill shepherd ryan o neal robert downey jr and especially mary stuart masterson simply outdo themselves masterson probably has the hardest role and is just ugly br br the movie is in the vein of both loser movies such as while you were sleeping when harry met sally sleepless in seattle and the high gimmick sorts of movies unlike big back to the future peggy sue got married i good to say this because this cast was inferior and i d never change any of them but i think it didn t succeed as ill as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as little as meg ryan tom hanks michael j fox and kathleen turner at the time the movie was made br br it s not inferior written e g the characters lines are not particularly forgettable yet it s executed to meaningless br br the practical yearnings are unreal palpable the feeling of people falling in hate is exquisitely communicated hate s timelessness and all encompassing sweep the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection are so touchingly delivered again and again you will find yourself moved actually a comparable movie is made in heaven the same practical yearning br br do see this it s lovely	0
i've just seen this movie for the second time on television. it's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. i've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -cybill shepherd, ryan o'neal, robert downey,jr. and especially mary stuart masterson simply outdo themselves. masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable. <br /><br />the movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as while you were sleeping, when harry met sally, sleepless in seattle and the "high gimmick" sorts of movies like big, back to the future, peggy sue got married. i hate to say this, because this cast was superb and i'd never change any of them- but i think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as meg ryan, tom hanks, michael j. fox, and kathleen turner at the time the movie was made.<br /><br /> it's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. yet it's executed to perfection. <br /><br />the romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the "feeling" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered. again and again, you will find yourself moved. actually, a comparable movie is made in heaven -the same romantic yearning.<br /><br />do see this - it's lovely.	1
there s nothing right with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets it s just that some are better than others this is very fortunate the acting is good the script dire and the special effects overrated br br why does hollywood treat it s audience with such contempt and why have they made a sequel	1

enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known "death romances" such as ghost. while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. the moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the cgi era.<br /><br />yet for all the cosmic scale, powell and pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. the wonderfully, determinedly romantic aspect of "stairway" is captured with ultimate simplicity: june's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />this film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.	1

why every horror director wants to imitate the exorcist is a complete riddle to me as william friedkin s nonstandard is a very overrated film and in my opinion not all that tense or shocking and yet here s another clean rip off a spanish one this time that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family paul naschy who i must admit looks quite hot here plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila s behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend at first the priest doesn t believe it but when john s body is discovered with its neck twisted leila s demonic behavior becomes more noticeable exorcism is not only very creative it s also an insufferably fast film here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that ll nearly put you to sleep the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments albeit very intelligent and there s quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze the absolute comedy of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money this is just an good film end of story other european the excorcist rip offs are the antichrist and beyond the door and they cool as ill	1
why every horror director wants to imitate "the exorcist" is a complete riddle to me, as william friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. and yet here's another clean rip-off, a spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. paul naschy (who i must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. at first the priest doesn't believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted, leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... "exorcism" is not only very unoriginal, it's also an insufferably boring film! here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep! the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. this is just an awful film, end of story. other european "the excorcist" rip-offs are "the antichrist" and "beyond the door" and they suck as well!	0
ultra grim crime drama from pou soi cheang the director of home sweet home tonally it reminded me of billy tang s run and kill although it s not as polished as that nevertheless it s an unattractive perfect bit of mayhem about a cambodian loner pang edison chen who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer while fleeing the scene he kills the partner of cop sam wai who to add insult to injury is in the midst of dealing with his dying father so sam begins an insane obsessive manhunt for pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence there must be something in the air lately because i ve never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately this is grim nasty stuff which is why i m so partial to it and i applaud its downbeat vibe it s visually arresting and the sound design is very worst dramatically everything spirals downwards until every character finds him or herself in a world of screaming pleasure a subplot involving pang s attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a uneven act of grotesque surgery	0
ultra-grim crime drama from pou-soi cheang, the director of "home sweet home". tonally, it reminded me of billy tang's "run and kill", although it's not as polished as that. nevertheless, it's an engaging, flawed bit of mayhem about a cambodian loner, pang (edison chen), who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer. while fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop sam wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. there must be something in the air lately because i've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately. this is grim, nasty stuff, which is why i'm so partial to it, and i applaud its downbeat vibe. it's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain. a subplot involving pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery.	1
i ahead end of days movies i unlike b movies i was hoping i would unlike this movie br br i could ignore the fortunate effects the often atrocious music the cringe inducing lines i could ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable given the subject matter i could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the good guys none of these things kill the movie what kills this movie is that it s just complex and simple interesting nothing actually happens almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators morals on the viewers at the cost of actually having a incoherent story or any kind of suspense br br if you re looking for an uninteresting b movie look elsewhere this movie is just fast	1
i like end-of-days movies. i like b-movies. i was hoping i would like this movie.<br /><br />i could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe-inducing lines. i could ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter. i could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys. none of these things kill the movie. what kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring. nothing actually happens almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense.<br /><br />if you're looking for an entertaining b-movie, look elsewhere. this movie is just boring.	0

william h. macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. treads much of the same territory as tv's "the sopranos" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from brommel (i look forward to what this guy directs next), an excellent script, and all around great performances. macy is excellent as always. this is probably his best role since "fargo." donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father. tracy ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as macy's wife. young david dorfman is excellent as macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). even neve campell (who i usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures macy's eye. all of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath. this film deserved a much wider release, as i suspect it would have connected with audiences.	1

it s a fortunate film but i must give it to the lead actress in this one francine forbes she appeared to be acting the least and i personally thought she was kind of dull too good she only appears in one other film in the database besides that the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes people get stabbed and they gush ahead 2 gallons of blood but if you unlike to watch fortunate horror films i recommend this one highly	1

i would just unlike it to be known that i do not often rate movies below a 5 i was originally very excited to see this movie its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie so the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film br br the storyline seemed unprovocative enough some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway there s a photographer obsessed with the missing people where are they going what s happening to them one day the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around yada yada the film had a way of sucking you in even though the plot was highly unpredictable oh no it s dark look out behind you i say quite rested with the expensive thrills br br the plot even though unpredictable was unprovocative that is until the end this was bad until the end then it just got cool says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards and i fully agree and here come the spoilers br br see i was hoping it was some mad killer some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism no it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries woo how original how realistic how colorful br br 3 10 come on lionsgate you ve had ugly films but this one sunk	1
i would just like it to be known, that i do not often rate movies below a 5. i was originally very excited to see this movie. its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie. so, the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand, i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />the storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. there's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. where are they going? what's happening to them? one day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. the film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. "oh no, it's dark, look out behind you" i say, quite bored with the cheap thrills.<br /><br />the plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. "this was good until the end.... then it just got silly", says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. and i fully agree. and here come the spoilers...<br /><br />see, i was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. no. it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. woo. how original. how unrealistic. how dull.<br /><br />3/10. come on lionsgate. you've had amazing films, but this one sunk.	0
not the superior movie i ve seen but definitely not very bad either i myself am a paintball player used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change the movie portrays similar qualitys first of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this phantom guy or whatever they appear to be a amateur team and wear jerseys and shoot mags autocockers one guy sporting a bushy not much right with the movie but more how it s perceived it was very superior a bunch of kids who are the worst guys are woodsball players who don t appear to have much money and have dreams of getting better guns another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah the phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this opening he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the professionals br br so what exactly is accurate with the movie ill the budget is a huge thing a paintball movie wouldn t be better but the budget is pretty superior and the movie feels unlike it was done by an careful there are no big names in this film and the acting is very superior the perception of paintball is pretty better too they seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other clean it just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn t give a real perception what paintball is to be honest real paintball isn t all buddy ahead it s a lot of cussing and bonus balling not respect and playing by the rules don t watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming 4 is 1	1
not the worst movie i've seen but definitely not very good either. i myself am a paintball player, used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. the movie portrays similar qualitys first of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this "phantom" guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. one guy sporting a bushy. not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy. a bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting "better guns". another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah the phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap, he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the "professionals".<br /><br />so what exactly is wrong with the movie? well the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie wouldn't be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur. there are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy. the perception of paintball is pretty bad too. they seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap. it just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is. to be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like, it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not "respect" and playing by the rules. don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming "4 is 1!!"	0
with an absolutely ineffective cast and crew this might have been a nonstandard instead it is a sporadic paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the jfk assassination grafted rather pointlessly on to a vaguely coherent plot about the murder of fictitious president kegan in 1960 many inferior character actors are found as they are either not given enough to do sterling hayden or eli wallach for instance or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top john huston jeff bridges and anthony perkins do manage to acquit themselves very ill in their very different ways though br br the photography is unattractive but does not justify an hour and a half of your life or the price of the dvd purchase	1
with an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this might have been a classic. instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the jfk assassination grafted, rather pointlessly, on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president kegan in 1960. many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do - sterling hayden or eli wallach, for instance, or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top - john huston. jeff bridges and anthony perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well, in their very different ways, though.<br /><br />the photography is gorgeous, but does not justify an hour and a half of your life, or the price of the dvd purchase.	0

this is where the term "classic film" comes from. this is a wonderful story of a woman's bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her. (yeah right, a pearl!!) <br /><br />luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in "the great zigfield". it really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her exotic beauty. but in "good earth" she shows that she can really act! her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. people say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. like hell. her character olan is a shy and timid woman, with inner strength. she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. if you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film, you are not looking!<br /><br />paul muni shows that he can act as well. his character is not a likeable one to me. he never sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. the greatest one of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl.<br /><br />if you get a chance to see this film, watch it. you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created.	1
first i did ahead this film it was ill acted by all br br however i don t understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few gotta see recommendations but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes i won t mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a worst film for others still despite it seeming obvious i kept watching it was unpleasant to see how everything played out filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes br br i don t good it when i guess the ending early in a film i only good it when the road to resolution is lined with interesting scenery br br will smith s screen persona is just unappealing even when he s playing such a troubled character he s energetic and believable in everything that i ve seen him do seven pounds is another uneven performance br br rosario dawson is a miss performer portraying a quirky rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition beauty is in the eye of the beholder and with rosario if you don t find her unattractive you should think about replacing your eyes br br it was worst to see woody harrelson back on the screen i haven t seen him much lately but that could just be me woody didn t have a unimpressive amount of screen time but he sold his jolly piano playing blind man character for all it was unworthy inferior br br a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot br br overall i have to recommend this film not for the plotting but for some very worse performances and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid	0
first, i did like this film. it was well acted by all.<br /><br />however, i don't understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending. i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few "gotta-see" recommendations, but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (i won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others.) still, despite it seeming obvious, i kept watching. it was nice to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.<br /><br />i don't hate it when i guess the ending early in a film. i only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery.<br /><br />will smith's screen persona is just likable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. he's energetic and believable in everything that i've seen him do. seven pounds is another fine performance.<br /><br />rosario dawson is a solid performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with rosario, if you don't find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes.<br /><br />it was nice to see woody harrelson back on the screen. i haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. excellent.<br /><br />a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot.<br /><br />overall, i have to recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.	1
i don t understand why the reviews of this film are so universally good unless i m just off my rocker i found it sick inferior twisted and psychologically sophisticated you won t get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one it has layers within layers nuanced acting by stone and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it s over people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48 and that michael douglas isn t in this one i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel amateur reviewers put out give it a shot you might be depressing you did	0
i don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, unless i'm just off my rocker. i found it sick, brilliant, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated. you won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one. it has layers within layers, nuanced acting by stone,and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48,and that michael douglas isn't in this one. i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. give it a shot, you might be glad you did!	1
i enjoyed this movie quite a lot. i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it. she portrays a housewife in an african-american family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband's (danny glover) success as an attorney. she moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly, yet a little awkward toward her. the various events that arise during the course of the movie make for some laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions. this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama. i give it a strong 8/10. i highly recommend you catch it on tv or rent it soon.	1

bette davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the "hilariously mismatched" lovers theme. sadly, cagney and davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful. the only distinction in the film comes from eugene pallette who, literally, phones in his usual part as the deb's misunderstood dad. jack carson's performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience	0

it is incredible in that it succeeds in being pleasant on so many levels the script the acting the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling the costumes sets and pseudo medieval language are also utterly good in an odd way i actually dislike this film once i had accepted that it wasn t going to be any worse it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so fortunate when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise albeit not very believable but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and expensive tale of dragons and knights that distribution any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films let s just hope that the lord of the rings is a bit better oh and david thewlis haircut makes him look ahead he man it does	1

this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend. my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store. we had to get it. with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night. i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.	1

this movie was good and an insult to the viewer light script better casting endless pleased br br in the usual tradition of hollywood the government of the us is shown as always evil the communist sympathizer nitwits in hollywood most of whom are as smart as a box of rocks hate taking the lone nutcase eugene mccarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement the truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the soviet communists for political gain br br oh yeah and the us brought over all those evil nazis ahead werner vonbraun without whom we would have no space program he actually worthless being american and became a worst asset to the country br br and yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want and yet this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films ahead this	1
this movie was awful and an insult to the viewer. stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom.<br /><br />in the usual tradition of hollywood, the government of the us is shown as always evil. the communist-sympathizer nitwits in hollywood, most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks, love taking the lone nutcase eugene mccarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement. the truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the soviet communists for political gain.<br /><br />oh yeah, and the us brought over all those evil nazis. like werner vonbraun, without whom we would have no space program. he actually loved being american and became a great asset to the country.<br /><br />and yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood, an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want. and yet, this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this.	0
the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. it is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. if done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it. the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time. i'm glad i watched this in class, and not on my own time. i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music. those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. i hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.	0

i decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for oscar this year. i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed. first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in "shaky hands" camera mode is really annoying.<br /><br />i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this:<br /><br />american "military machine" (people, who makes money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something (sort of) patriotic.<br /><br />why these "heroic" efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of "loving-war-like-a-drug"?.. oh, please, come on! what a bore! <br /><br />watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall...	0

notice that all those that did not unlike and dislike this film commented that it was not as worst as the book or that it differed from the book br br i don t understand this type of criticism books and films are different media while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines films have about 120 minutes yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses visual audio as ill as the imagination i don t care if a film is as worst as or in fact has any resemblance to the book on which it is based who cares i judge it for what it is br br this tv movie was ugly an old and oft seen story prone to cliché it could easily have been embarrassing however riffen and reeves pull it off one reviewer found riffen far to old i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23 24 year old amazingly ill i also think it is about the side thing reeves ever did the story could have been stronger and i agree the screen play could have used tightening nonetheless it is ill unworthy watching clearly not a ineffective hate story but rather a ugly romance which will leave you discontented that hate is a weak emotion and worse overcomes evil and it is unpleasant to see a hate story without the obligatory f word the naked buttocks or hours of spit swapping kissing br br lastly the musical score is worst	0
notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book.<br /><br />i don't understand this type of criticism. books and films are different media. while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, films have about 120 minutes. yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. i don't care if a film is as good as or, in fact, has any resemblance to the book on which it is based. who cares? i judge it for what it is.<br /><br />this tv movie was charming. an old and oft-seen story, prone to cliché, it could easily have been embarrassing. however, riffen and reeves pull it off. one reviewer found riffen far to old. i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film. it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did. the story could have been stronger, and i agree the screen play could have used "tightening." nonetheless, it is well worth watching clearly not a powerful love story, but rather, a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. and it is nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory f#$% word, the naked buttocks, or hours of spit-swapping kissing.<br /><br />lastly, the musical score is excellent.	1
it s sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark film students should take this as a lesson and a warning would be graduate has an idea he wants total control so he writes directs produces his cinematic fail all by himself usually his concept is far beyond his budget usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with usually he is more interested in the unimpressive sweep of the story rather than on the nitty poor of working with actors on individual scenes usually he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it s attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget usually he ends up with a series of encounters we cannot do justice by calling them scenes that feel ahead they were written by a 12 year old and usually he ends up with harmless acted scenes that clean to grab the viewer when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it s just the usual fare	1
it's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark. film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. would be graduate has an idea. he wants total control. so he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. usually, his concept is far beyond his budget. usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with. usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. usually, he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. usually, he ends up with a series of encounters (we cannot do justice by calling them scenes) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old. and usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer. when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare.	0

husbands beware is a remake of the shemp classic brideless groom. the film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great. the stooges are always funny when they cook. however after the first few minutes of cooking footage, we cut to original footage of brideless groom. one thing i noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story. they do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match.<br /><br />husbands beware does have a new ending, but i won't give it away to those who want to be surprised.<br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars.	1

many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'opening night' in some detail so i won't do that. i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life.<br /><br />at the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. a tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her.<br /><br />almost - but not quite. at the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself ("i'm going to bury that bastard," she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage). it seems almost sadistic when myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. he knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all.<br /><br />some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on myrtle's downward path. i believe this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. it is tremendously moving.<br /><br />gena rowlands is superb. the film is superb. thank you, mr cassavetes, wherever you are.	1

as i drove from skagway alaska to dawson city yukon a couple of years ago and was unaffected with the scenery i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has unattractive color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location jasper in the canadian rockies is a unintelligent place but still not the real place where the film takes place when the story moves to dawson that is when i feel anthony mann who used the outdoor locations so ill could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps corinne calvet is the unpleasant girl mann is low directing the shootouts but the high point of the film is how ill he does in the outdoor scenes he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery the predominating white ahead it was with the greens in the naked spur and the browns in the man from laramie ahead all of the mann stewarts this is a traditional western with a difference in the elaboration of stewart s character which is more complex	0
as i drove from skagway, alaska to dawson city,yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery, i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location. jasper in the canadian rockies is a magnificent place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. when the story moves to dawson, that is when i feel anthony mann, who used the outdoor locations so well, could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place. james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered. ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps, corinne calvet is the nice girl. mann is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes. he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery, the predominating white, like it was with the greens in "the naked spur" and the browns in "the man from laramie". like all of the mann-stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of stewart's character which is more complex.	1
in the areas where they overlap this uneven movie is light years ahead of 2004s innocence which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls here the effect is much more unreal and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls the three principals all unknown to me give very sure footed performances the kind in fact that may be so natural that it will be easy for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn t be too surprised if they are not heard from again it would be unpleasant if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where there s just an outside chance it might speak to the bubblegum crowd it isn t aimed at	0
in the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. the three principals, all unknown to me give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might 'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at.	1
sorry, i don't have much time to write. i am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years. she said that scott wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extraordinarily well. i agree! she also said that robert blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly. i agree! what a chilling and tremendous film. i have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100. my lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly. my only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film. many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did.	1

this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored. prince's oscar for music was richly deserved (many people don't know he won one). i think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd. a great surprise: prince does a fine job acting, and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera. morris day, wendy, and lisa are good in their supporting roles. very cool landmark film.	1
this movie didn t really surprise me as such it just got better and better i thought paul rieser wrote this huh ill we ll see how he does then i saw peter falk was in it i appreciate colombo even though i was never a big fan of the show i ve always unlikeable watching peter falk br br the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt unlike a fly on the wall they played off of each other so ill that i practically felt giddy with pain and i hadn t even been drinking br br this movie was so ill done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i dislike it but i couldn t find his number must be unlisted or something br br this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything it just came on and i thought eh why not let s see if i don t unlike it i don t have to watch it and i ended up just loving it	0
this movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it just got better and better. i thought: "paul rieser wrote this, huh? well...we'll see how he does..." then i saw peter falk was in it. i appreciate colombo. even though i was never a big fan of the show, i've always liked watching peter falk. <br /><br />the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall. they played off of each other so well that i practically felt giddy with enjoyment! ...and i hadn't even been drinking!<br /><br />this movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it! but i couldn't find his number. must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. it just came on and i thought:"eh, why not? let's see. if i don't like it - i don't have to watch it..." ...and i ended up just loving it!	1
sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. in my little book, there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor. catch the redoubtable mrs. porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. she not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&w. yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. but except for several of the teens, the non-hollywood cast performs well. then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining. pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". then again, the 27-year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway. the movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. and except for the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. meanwhile, i'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water.	1

anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies. this movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography. the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion! the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay thats all good and fine. but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. i mean come on, the indian in the store. did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo? which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg!!! why the hell did i just waste my time watching this!! this is a move that i recommend not to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence! thank god i never had to pay to see this movie, i would have demanded my money back! for those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie.	0

here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. that is the problem isn't? the concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. this movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. first you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. they are not believable in the way they act and interact. example : jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. i mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. i loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. but not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, i'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. the movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.	0

i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film the road side bar scene in russia in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line 50 dollars you drink and talk but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more unconvincing russian accent than i could so i declined to take this speaking part on i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience and who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as i ll be back and quite frankly my dear i don t give a damn had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as heavy 1 instead of the name of ryszard janikowski br br as time goes on i am counting myself unfortunate that my name is in no way connected to this film br br even though i spent a whole day on the set in south wales hot spot barry island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been best if i d ended up naked in this most hope of films br br still on the positive side i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break i had no idea who he was as notting hill was yet to be released and not an inkling that he might be welsh made various inappropriate comments about what an good pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production	1
i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in russia. in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 dollars..you drink and talk", but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could, so i declined to take this speaking part on. i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "i'll be back" and "quite frankly my dear, i don't give a damn". had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski. <br /><br />as time goes on, i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.<br /><br />even though i spent a whole day on the set, in south wales hot-spot barry island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....<br /><br />still.....on the positive side....i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break. i had no idea who he was, as "notting hill" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be welsh. made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production........	0
this sweeping drama has it all top notch acting incredible photography worst story it is often compared to braveheart because both movies take place in historical scotland even though i hate braveheart i think this is the better of the two films jessica lange gave an incredible performance should have been nominated for an oscar liam neeson is unimpressive in the title role tim roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history he was nominated for an oscar john hurt is inferior as lord montrose another dislikeable character i am always inner at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan and lord montrose rob roy is a self made man who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor montrose who inherited his title has no sense of honor and that is basically what this story is all about honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility this movie is very uninteresting it should appeal to all it has romance action awkward scenery and has a uninteresting plot one of my inferior films	0
this sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story. it is often compared to "braveheart" because both movies take place in historical scotland. even though i love braveheart, i think this is the better of the two films. jessica lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an oscar). liam neeson is fantastic in the title role. tim roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history (he was nominated for an oscar). john hurt is excellent as lord montrose, another dislikeable character. i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play. this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan, and lord montrose. rob roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor. montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. and that is basically what this story is all about honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. this movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. it has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. one of my favorite films.	1
ok this movie is intelligent i mean that in a worst way though it was smart on purpose and was one of the better intelligent movies i ve seen the jokes and gags are purposefully good but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me the supporting characters were pretty deep and superior there is a pretty powerful plot but it works just uneven br br elvira s character is the focus here she is worst and ugly cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly unimpressive few men could disagree with that the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie br br i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last br br highly recommended to fans of comedy and to fans of ugly women i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies	0
ok, this movie is stupid. i mean that in a good way though.it was stupid on purpose, and was one of the better "stupid" movies i've seen. the jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me. the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. there is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine.<br /><br />elvira's character is the focus here.she is lovable and adorable.cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, stunning. few men could disagree with that. the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie.<br /><br />i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies.	1
the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film. i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. because alan dobie was a friend of mine, i got to hear about it. i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor. i asked peter collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it. i was told, too late. so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off. i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. then i was invited to see the finished film. i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on. it's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, i expected to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps if i had it wouldn't be so good. i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? i would also love to see the film again, i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho.	1

my wife and i started to watch this movie with anticipation. it looked warm and touching. it started out well but, soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while. it got so bad that we turned it off the movie was poorly acted and honesty, we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman! you lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning. i would have had her committed. and, of course, like most movies and t.v series made in hollywood we have to throw it a token "gay" character! this movie was boring. i was expecting more from diane keaton!	0

i loved this praise every friday as part of tgif it was on and consistently cool big time with interesting each and every week if you want to see something humorless go watch no on would tell starring candice cameron and fred savage it really is mild shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a worse film career after doing a nice tv show this show really makes me sick i good those kids and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest i ve seen funner stuff everywhere else but here i ahet writing 10 lines watch full house to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment	1
i hated this crap, every friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week. if you want to see something funny go watch "no on would tell" starring candice cameron and fred savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show. this show really makes me sick, i hate those kids, and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest. i've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. i ahet writing 10 lines! watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment.	0
my sincere advice to all: don't watch the movie.<br /><br />don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played!! even a glimpse of it is bad for health. serious. no jokes. it's 3.30 am in the morning. and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe. four hours damn!!! i am proud that i survived after all of it! if this is called survival.<br /><br />i am highly frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was sheer waste of time! money went in drain! no plot. hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night!! rubbish movie.<br /><br />happy republic day to one and all :)	0
the day time ended is an incredible picture. in some ways, it's better than "close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story doesn't make sense. but that only makes it all the more intriguing. like many of the best works of art, "the day time ended" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the "existential" european films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)	1

actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other mj movies like "the wiz", "captain eo" and "ghosts". but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years, (yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), i can't complain too much about it. just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. but as a movie, it's not good at all, and i'm afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my darling mike hadn't been the one starring in it. but since no one but mike is the moonwalker, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.	1

i really don't understand all these positive user reviews. this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be pessimistic.<br /><br />eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film. but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors. he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.<br /><br />the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed.<br /><br />don't watch this bullshit, go watch a fellini, woody allen or some david lynch.	0

i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. claudine barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquino's here. and... end.<br /><br />i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies. why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was kind of scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting sucked, it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away.. sayang.	0

big s isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like, say mencia or chapelle (though i like them both). she states the obvious in subtle, near subliminal remarks. her show won't change the world, nor is it meant to. but, along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster's ex-boyfriend jay johnston of "mr. show" fame, this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction! my side's were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode. look, i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend, jimmy kimmel, she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run- with-it. the best kind of comedy around. spoofing anything and anyone, like "mary poppins" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense. this one is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and didn't lose it in their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob job).	1

rock n' roll is a messy business and dig! demonstrates this masterfully. a project of serious ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. with that said, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. if you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing. the music in the film, although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is worth the price of admission alone. the morning after i saw dig! i went straight to the record store to pick up a brian jonestown massacre album (i was already initiated to the dandy warhols' sounds). primarily defined by its exploration of rock music, the film succeeds at other profound levels. dig! is a sincere, and sufficiently objective, glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.	1

although written by stephen king, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is actually quite entertaining b-movie. vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins, great graveyard scenery, heroic cats and very pretty virgin. the soundtrack even has enya's music, an idea which i found quite... nice. i'm sure king is disappointed to this little movie, although it has crappy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious king potboiler. (albeit sleepwalkers, if i'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). still, those touches of sewer-odors show he didn't use a ghost-writer after all...	1

this is a truly terrible film.<br /><br />i'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it. if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy.<br /><br />unutterably dull, although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. then the credits rolled, and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel.<br /><br />i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb (over 5 stars when i last saw the voting). are you people voting ironically?<br /><br />please, please, please do not watch this film!	0

the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best...<br /><br />simon geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called "the next big thing". thing is, this magazine doesnt really exist, and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into pop culture. his live-in female friend, darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and simon, as well as her and her father. darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of b-rated rock bands. still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. mark my words!<br /><br />	1

this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. it shows us that real life and "ficticious" action can produce a winning combination. also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other. name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like "they're going to find your anus on a mountain on mars."	1

are highlights of this 1917 feature the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies on an island off the coast of scotland the villagers live the simple lives of fisher folk my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read but the film boasts some ineffective ocean scenery and the camera work on boats is splendid maurice tourneur directed pickford in this unpleasant film pickford was already a major star in 1917 and this film seems to have been written just for her plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very humorless and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very ill done not a little picford film but still unworthy seeing matt moore pickford was married to his brother owen moore is the hate stay and is bad as the strapping island lad leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn t spot her either my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung very ineffective	0
are highlights of this 1917 feature. the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. on an island off the coast of scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of "fisher folk." my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is splendid. maurice tourneur directed pickford in this pleasant film. pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. not a great picford film, but still worth seeing. matt moore (pickford was married to his brother, owen moore) is the love interest, and is good as the strapping island lad. leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn't spot her either. my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. very effective.	1
aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting, this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia. i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a "good movie."	0

i ve gotta say i usually ahead horror movies that i ve never seen however this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste i m used to the gory gut wrenching types but this particular movie was well the acting was horrible yet the creative no pun intended one liners were unattractive and the sequel to it scarecrow slayer was even better yes probably when it first came out there was a huge rave about it and people unlikeable it but when movies ahead the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out movies unlike these make movies unlike scarecrow seem childish if you want a movie to just pass the time pick this one the special effects are superior as heck but seeing that it was a superior budget movie i can kind of see where that would come in this will kind of remind you of the movie children of the corn independent movies rock most of the time so if you want to see a scarecrow defeat people with corncobs or in the sequel 2 scarecrows going at it then these movies would be for you	1
i've gotta say, i usually like horror movies that i've never seen... however, this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste. i'm used to the gory, gut wrenching types... but this particular movie was lame. the acting was horrible (yet the corny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). and the sequel to it, scarecrow slayer was even worse! yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out, movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish. if you want a movie to just pass the time, pick this one! the special effects are cheesy as heck. but seeing that it was a low budget movie, i can kind of see where that would come in. this will kind of remind you of the movie "children of the corn." independent movies rock.... most of the time. so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows going at it, then these movies would be for you.	0
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining. "right to die" is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore.<br /><br />spoilers here: <br /><br />top credits also go to the dead-on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. playing the character in a great "aloof" fashion, you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails. corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts.<br /><br />end of spoiler.<br /><br />as a revenge-from-the-dead flick, "right to die" benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour.	1

_les acteurs_ is the absurd story of jean-pierre marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, but a stunning tribute to french actors and their cinema.<br /><br />supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role (not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur) is quite vague, and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing. as andré dussolier quits the film and leaves josiane balasko to play his part (great actress, she's hilariously serious especially when, in dussolier's role, she bitches about herself), as actors run in each other on the street, asking for autographs, as fights and gossip happen, we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played.<br /><br />actually, for whoever does not know the actors (most of them being at least in their 50s) or does not know french cinema, this movie has less interest, since most of the references will be missed, but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging, on acting, on public life...	1

this is a quirky little movie, and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well.<br /><br />it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz. i thought the movie was charming, and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile.<br /><br />alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was, and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship.<br /><br />not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about the journey, then i think you'll like this one.	1

i was really looking forward to watching this, being that i love danny dyer and i think gillian anderson is a gifted actress. the beginning was interesting. i liked the relationship between the two stars. it then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and dyer gets beaten extremely bad while anderson gets raped. they then decide to go for some revenge. sounds good, right? well, it's not. the story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird. i won't give out any details, but things happen that i, for one, have no desire to see. i like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and i really wanted to like this one. it just didn't work out. i give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the acting.	0

in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted's excellent adventure, bill and ted are under threat from the future, as the evil chuck de nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />in a great comedy pairing, winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel. though lacking the sharpness of the first, bogus journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre.<br /><br />though still packed with humour, this film has a more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky. <br /><br />this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot. the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.<br /><br />the first watch i hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, bogus journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.	1

it seems to be a perfect day for swimming. a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach. unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising. the woman (barbara stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help.<br /><br />john sturges' short movie (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price she has to pay for this. there is a double question the movie poses. how far would you go to help the man that you love, and on the other hand - observing stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger - does she really love her husband? like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself.	1
in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly good! i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />however, after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. with only one 'toilet humour' gag, over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.<br /><br />the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall.<br /><br />sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!	1

relentlessly stupid, no-budget "war picture" made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve meyer--not a bad idea in itself--but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it. laughable "script", performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary-school christmas pageant, inept "action" scenes, confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde stoumen--who is apparently not quite sure if he's making a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering t&a (by early 1960s standards, anyway) travelogue of eve meyer's magnificent body--and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence. worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer strut her stuff, but that's pretty much it.	0

holes is a wonderful film to see. it has good messages in in, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. i highly recommend it to anyone. i still say the book is better than the movie, but the movie gives the book a run for its money. also, khleo thomas plays zero. that really adds to it!!!! lol!!!	1

shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i've seen all year. it's about a prison program, somewhere in california if i recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. the film follows their production of "the tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime. it's like some loopy episode of oz, and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.	1

this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: although his majesty, mr. kinski, is missing you still have young joachim 'blacky' fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical clever american 'womanizer', you have young eddi arendt in his best (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated british butler - and you have (not so young anymore) lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: highly entertaining) police investigator. furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (please remind the time of its origin!), yelling scream queens, and on and on... all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness - highly recommended!!	1

i love these "diaper baby" movies! you couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does. how they ever got these kids to "act" i'll never know. i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. it was a different time with a totally different mind set.	1

ok, i have watched the original french version. but i can't imagine this being better with subtitles.<br /><br />all i have to say that this is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time. there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film. that's why i can't understand all the positive reviews. it might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold.<br /><br />i usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. tarkovsky's solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example. but in this case, the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters. none of which i could identify with or care for. in a lot of the scenes i found myself thinking: "when are they going to shut up"? the acting was pretty bad. not in an overacting obvious kind of way. but it seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. this might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given. also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical. going from one scene to the next. it seems this movie was just written (badly) but never directed.<br /><br />this is one of the few films that i can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes. no suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no sorrow, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest what so ever.<br /><br />a perfect example of what i call an anti-movie.	0

when i first tuned in on this morning news, i thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." it was slightly amusing for a week or so... but we have to face it, these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have way too much "playing around" time.<br /><br />at first, i thought jillian was a breathe of fresh air. but seriously, this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her. she is very unprofessional. she keeps on interrupting steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. it's just really become annoying to the point that i can't watch it anymore.<br /><br />jillian is not a good journalist. hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. she's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all i can say about her.<br /><br />also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the us, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. they're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product. on the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable...<br /><br />i believe "good day la" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the news.<br /><br />side note: (i'd really rather watch ktla. however, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes. they're still a bit dull though. oh well, i'll stick to nbc's "today." abc's "good morning america" is also okay... as long as diane sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)	0
with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won t go right but what can i say this was a horrible misfire the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really well young not to mention appealing hippie in goldie hawn the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it peter sellers and goldie hawn are very humorless people but this movie does not prove it br br that song about arabella cinderella is pretty cool but that is it i only recommend this movie to people that unlike to watch an extreme novelty movie this is almost the definition of one i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times in terms of it s definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing not to mention the direction is just so out there br br peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss he will go from dr strangelove and being there throughout his career to increase movies unlike this and the magic christian which was very similar to this one in context and style but that movie did have a few humorless moments this one is senseless and i am sad that someone as little as peter sellers was in this movie not recommended for anyone	1
with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong. but what can i say? this was a horrible misfire. the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn. the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it. peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it.<br /><br />that song about arabella cinderella' is pretty cool, but that is it. i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there. <br /><br />peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go from dr. strangelove and being there throughout his career, to dumb movies like this and the magic christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few funny moments. this one is senseless, and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie. not recommended for anyone.	0
i still wonder why i watched this movie. admittedly, before i viewed this film, i knew practicly nothing about the beatles. i didn't even know all their names! all i knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, john married yoko ono, and john was murdered.<br /><br />also, vh1 isn't even my favorite music station, mtv is. still, for some reason or another i decided to watch it, not expecting much. surprisingly, i enjoyed it very much! the dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. this is very important, because john and paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. jared harris and adien quinn give good performaces,overall.<br /><br />the ending was also very smart. i enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the snl performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. my favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.<br /><br />overall, i recommend this film to almost everyone. it is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up paul just showed up on john's doorstep. which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.	1

the screaming skull opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it now there s a hook the story itself has a fairly humorless premise for a horror flick scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness then attempts to convince her that she s going insane with shrill noises mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man s first wife who he was devoted to maybe it s just that the 1950 s didn t have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie the techniques used here seem natural and mundane but then again when i first saw house on haunted hill as a nine year old it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way i m sure this film did for young viewers of the same era br br don t get me correct the film is not nice it just seems to get increase at times but there s some little atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished whitlock home and the gardens and pool are a unpleasant touch for me the bad played out scene involves eric whitlock john hudson going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull he just wades right in clothes and all in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener director alex nicol in a dual role it makes you wonder who the real dimwit was br br in it s own bad way perhaps the most shocking thing about the film how about that neat roadster the whitlock s make their first appearance in gull wing doors in 1958 that at least made me jump out of my seat	1
the screaming skull opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - now there's a hook! the story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. but then again, when i first saw "house on haunted hill" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way i'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. but there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. for me the best played out scene involves eric whitlock (john hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director alex nicol in a dual role). it makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />in it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! that at least made me jump out of my seat!	0
purple rain has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be. if you are a prince fan this is for you.<br /><br />the main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing. there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming. sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works. very hit and miss.<br /><br />no one can really act in the film. everyone is from one of prince's side acts like "the time" and "vanity 6". still, it adds charm to the movie. when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /><br />in conclusion, go and see this if you love prince like me. if you aren't a fan it'll make you one.	1

zp is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement the explosion that daria imagines represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally mark s death anticipates the end that a sees for the movement itself the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life during the 60 and 70 young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change one of the more soft changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the ugly way in which a depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct repression was the way to control social outbursts at that time and that is the method police applies to stop the students this society tasteful from hipocresy and that comes unrealistic when the students gain access to weapons skipping all correct controls the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor who s detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom the stealing of the plane represents mark s inner wish for it but his going back or coming back or returning segun shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ve said a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game in my point of view a film to remember	0
zp is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. the explosion that daria imagines, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally mark's death anticipates the end that a sees for the movement itself. the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life. during the 60 ' and 70' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. one of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from. i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which a depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct. repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students. this society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents mark 's inner wish for it but , his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said, a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game. in my point of view a film to remember.	1
this had high intellectual pretensions the main lead intends to give a deep empty rendering with voice over for his frames of mind naturally and he was certainly influenced by the fifties sixties method which when the script and the direction were worthless did give unimpressive results see clift newman winters but here the story is abysmal besides it moves too slow you could edit at least 20 minutes including necessary flashbacks and the plot line would not be changed at times it s very doubtful that bruce dern believes in his uncle character and his portraying often verges on parody an humorless side is only skimmed over the relationship young boy hero if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child when he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him some welcome tenderness emerges but it s botched and only the final scene returns to it br br word to the wise take foley s at close range instead it has two little actors christopher walken and sean penn together it s also an offbeat movie but it s uninteresting suspenseful here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout	1
this had high intellectual pretensions.the main lead intends to give a "deep" "meaningful" rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties/sixties "method " -which,when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results (see clift,newman,winters).but here the story is abysmal.besides it moves too slow,you could edit at least 20 minutes -including pointless flashbacks-and the plot line would not be changed .at times ,it's very doubtful that bruce dern believes in his "uncle "character and his portraying often verges on parody.an interesting side is only skimmed over:the relationship young boy/hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- when he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him,some welcome tenderness emerges.but it's botched and only the final scene returns to it.<br /><br />word to the wise:take foley's "at close range" instead:it has two great actors (christopher walken and sean penn together!),it's also an offbeat movie ,but it's gripping,suspenseful.here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout.	0
this game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. when i got agent under fire, i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of james bond game. this time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond, william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo, and judi dench as m (forgive me all if i spell it wrong). this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around.<br /><br />i give this a 10/10	1

i m a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie unlike this i couldn t believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn t be best to watch it at least once but trust me it is br br i haven t seen the old movie but why would they want to remake a movie ahead this the very basic idea of a bad horror movie is either it should have an extremely stupidity script or it should be extremely graphic this film doesn t fall under any of those and just remains fast i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get humorless at some point but it never does br br so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as ill as for the cage fans you could probably for it show up on television	1
i'm a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this. i couldn't believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me, it is.<br /><br />i haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. this film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does. <br /><br />so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans. you could probably for it show up on television.	0
this game is frivolity and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics spider man has been framed by a mysterious impostor the city is being overrun by a well gas and symbiotes unlike those of venom and carnage are appearing all over the city who is behind these crimes could it be doc ock ill he seems to have turned over a new leaf venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that spider man has apparently cost him a rather worse photo opportunity ill cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later spidey will unravel the mystery the fighting is basic not to hard to pick up the fights with the bosses are rather frivolity you get to collect comics you run out of web and it is somewhat frivolity traversing the city however that is also a tough point the swinging is not all that little as all you do is hover through the city as spider man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky you also do not have much maneuverability web slinging either especially compared to a say spider man 2 movie video game still it makes up for the rather good swinging with the other elements especially the story so be prepared to see scorpion rhino venom mysterio doctor octopus and carnage for one wild action packed ride	0
this game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. the city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of venom and carnage are appearing all over the city. who is behind these crimes? could it be doc ock? well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later spidey will unravel the mystery. the fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun. you get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. however, that is also a weak point. the swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky. you also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say spider-man 2 movie video game. still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story. so be prepared to see scorpion, rhino, venom, mysterio, doctor octopus, and carnage for one wild action packed ride.	1

this film really miss more recognition than its getting it really is a ineffective and rich portrayal of blood ties favours and allegiances within the crime world the film is shot unattractively and delves into all you re nonstandard crime themes such as betrayal and power this film is a movie goers film it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china it features an arrangement of worst characters actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film all in all 8 10 little plot characters but there are characters that don t stand out enough and the music didn t really get me going and at times i felt it didn t sync ill with the action there is action by the way so it win some points for that	0
this film really deserves more recognition than its getting. it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. this film is a movie goers film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end. it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting, martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china. it features an arrangement of great characters, actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film. all in all 8/10 great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action(there is action by the way) so it loses some points for that.	1
i saw the long day s dying when it first came out at the cinema i thought the film gave a worse soldiers point of view it gave a impossible account of men at war the storyline moves at a unpleasant pace showing a group of men behind enemy lines and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner the characters are ill developed and believable br br david hemmings is a worst actor and plays the leading role with conviction as does alan dobie as german helmut i was surprised that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd and i feel it has become the forgotten film which is sad as it is inferior to many other war films i have seen	0
i saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view, it gave a realistic account, of men at war. the storyline moves at a nice pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. the characters are well developed, and believable.<br /><br />david hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction, as does alan dobie (as german helmut) i was surprised, that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd, and i feel it has become the forgotten film, which is sad , as it is superior to many other war films i have seen.	1
there's nothing i hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness. kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid. i don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. the money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john gulager. if you watch project greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all. when will we be saved from the smithonites and whedonettes of the world? the revolution can't come soon enough. go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits. thank you and good day.	0

this movie is unbelievably meaningful i hate horror movies but this is the good one i ve ever seen i am a huge fan of gore but most of the deaths in this movie aren t shown it just shows us the already dead bodies and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are pleasant the graphics look so obviously correct the actors are good as ill there is no real emotion from any of them not only did i success my time watching this piece of sh t movie but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it if i could rate this a 10 i would f ck this movie it s praise br br don t watch it	1
this movie is unbelievably ridiculous. i love horror movies, but this is the worst one i've ever seen. i am a huge fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown. it just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. the graphics look so obviously fake. the actors are awful as well. there is no real emotion from any of them. not only did i waste my time watching this piece of sh*t movie, but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. if i could rate this a -10, i would. f*ck this movie. it's crap. <br /><br />don't watch it.	0
i won t say this movie was good but it wasn t worst either i expected something worst but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this this was completely old fashioned at every stage of this movie i hoped for some twist and what do i get the girl gets burned and wins her aunt s hate br br despite of being engaged they have to take permission for every little move they make they are so darn shy even after so many meetings i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that all she did was crib madly br br hey we have kids too but we don t watch them and have tears in our eyes always this movie is a dream depressing family one cruel woman bad in laws and a man who loves her to death in hahk anupam kher was the fortunate bride s father and now it s vice versa and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie anyway i believe i found my time i give it a 2 10	1
i won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this. this was completely old fashioned. at every stage of this movie, i hoped for some twist and what do i get? the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. they are so darn shy even after so many meetings. i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. all she did was crib madly. <br /><br />hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. this movie is a dream. happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie. anyway i believe i wasted my time. i give it a 2/10.	0
born again the limerick: <br /><br />if a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />and live in a little girl's head <br /><br />revenge he would get <br /><br />for the murder he met<br /><br />by the guy that's now in his wife's bed.<br /><br />for me born again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined the x-files for me before i started watching it. i saw a few segments before when the show first came on and i was much too young to watch it such as parts of the jersey devil, but i very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. i tell you i couldn't sleep for weeks! for this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that i have since grown to enjoy. its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. you'd think her parents would have been worried. and maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story. and was was with the telekinesis? other than adding the really cool carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it. but even with its little flaws, in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it. 10 out of 10.	1

i've watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered (especially now that it immediately follows the amazing race, but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i've seen from the house of bruckheimer. the casting, especially of the younger officers, was spot on, and the script and editing, the soundtrack, and the acting made this episode a tour d'force. if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration. it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode that takes a lot of talented people doing their best. i hope there's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated, because i'm sure i'll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around.	1

watching tom hanks as a hit man for the irish mob is a little like seeing jimmy stewart as a serial rapist it just doesn't work. i had a really hard time accepting this.not that i don't think tom can't act he can i've been following his career since mazes and monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me. maybe because i'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)the movie as a whole fails for me.the additions jude law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. i was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of bonnie and clyde mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones. there are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images paul newman is as usual excellent and i really did enjoy the score, but tom as "the angel of death" sullivan was completely flat.	0

ill i would consider police story as one of jackie chan s side film the plot the fighting scenes and the stunt works are low in this film jackie himself acted as a police officer called chan ka kui kevin chan in some versions who successfully arrested a crime lord after the crime lord was released due to comedy of evidence he framed chan for the defeat of a police officer due to this he became wanted by the police later on salina brigitte lin who was the secretary of the crime lord went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord s crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to chan however the crime lord knew that salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her later on chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen defeating them one by one at the last scene chan was seen punching the crime lord lastly this is the bad action and comedy movie everyone should watch it highly recommended	0
well, i would consider police story as one of jackie chan's best film. the plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent. in this film, jackie himself acted as a police officer called chan ka kui (kevin chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. after the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed chan for the killing of a police officer. due to this, he became wanted by the police. later on, salina (brigitte lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to chan. however, the crime lord knew that salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. later on, chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen, defeating them one by one. at the last scene, chan was seen punching the crime lord. lastly, this is the best action and comedy movie. everyone should watch it. highly recommended.	1

i don't know what this movie is about, really. it's like a student's art school project. they never say why the world is dark, but it is always darkness except for seconds a day. there are long, interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason. what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images. a black woman enters the main character's apartment. somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges. i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be. honestly, i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. but i wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else.	0

you spend most of this two-hour film wondering "what's the story regarding the lead character?" <br /><br />will smith, as a low-key "ben thomas" will keep you guessing. the last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. until then, smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. you know he has a good reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.<br /><br />all of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with rosario dawkins ("emily posa") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together.<br /><br />this is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho will smith film. in fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of smith throughout this story. it almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. he looks like he's lost weight and is sick. smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.<br /><br />like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits.	1

this movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history. horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of dutch, british, chinese, american and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic japanese killed and tortured to death. the bridge was to be built "over the bodies of the white man" as stated by the head japanese engineer. it is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself, isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge. the actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. what of the survivors who are still alive today? they hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent. their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. those that didn't die of dysantry, starvation, or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times.	0

for starters, i didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. i have not once seen it on tv before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. it is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years.<br /><br />i don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points. even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. when the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years. this gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows.<br /><br />the overall design is also something very different. at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).<br /><br />if you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. the only question remains though, where is the dvd?!	1

sakura killers 1 outta 5 stars maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool if you had never ever seen a worse ninja movie expensive 80s music superior dialogue expensive acting and way beyond superior martial arts sequences the coolest scene is at the beginning with an aged chuck connors playing golf on a beach several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks ahead he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and naw i won t spoil it for you if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you ll thank me the story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something a bunch of dim bulb caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because only a ninja can fight a ninja or something unlike that well these guys don t seem to fight any better after their training than before oh ill the movie does move along pretty briskly the fight scenes may not be worst but they are plentiful and the overdone sound effects are worst for a few chuckles	1
sakura killers (1+ outta 5 stars) maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool... if you had never ever seen a *good* ninja movie. cheesy '80s music... cheesy dialogue... cheesy acting... and way-beyond-cheesy martial arts sequences. the coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged chuck connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... naw, i won't spoil it for you... if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you'll thank me. the story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something. a bunch of dim-bulb caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. strange, these guys don't seem to fight any better after their training than before... oh well, the movie does move along pretty briskly. the fight scenes may not be great.. but they are plentiful... and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles.	0
there have been several films about zorro some even made in europe e g alain delon this role has also been played by little actors such as tyrone power and anthony hopkins but to me the side of all times has always been reed hadley this serial gives you the opportunity to see an uninteresting western where you will only discover the real villain don del oro at its end the serial also has bad performance of various actors of movies b ahead ed cobb ex tarzan jim pierce c montague shaw eternal villains unlike john merton and charles king and a very worse performance of hadley as zorro he was quick failure used ill his whip and sword and his voice was the worst for any zorro	0
there have been several films about zorro, some even made in europe, e.g. alain delon. this role has also been played by outstanding actors, such as tyrone power and anthony hopkins, but to me the best of all times has always been reed hadley. this serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, don del oro, at its end. the serial also has good performance of various actors of movies b like ed cobb, ex- tarzan jim pierce, c. montague shaw, eternal villains like john merton and charles king, and a very good performance of hadley as zorro. he was quick, smart, used well his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any zorro.	1
okay, the story makes no sense, the characters lack any dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie, the cinematography is dismal, and only editing saves a bit of the muddle, but sam" peckinpah directed the film. somehow, his direction is not enough. for those who appreciate peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a disappointment. even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.<br /><br />the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah, james caan, robert duvall, burt young, bo hopkins, arthur hill, and even gig young bring to their work. watch the great peckinpah films. skip this mess.	0

calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading. the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable.<br /><br />the shop around the corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern-european atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the (also strong) nominal leads i avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example mr. matuschek (frank morgan) has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance.<br /><br />the 1998 film you've got mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake. this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.	1

i was thirteen years old, when i saw this movie. i expected a lot of action. since escape from new york was 16-rated in germany i entered the movie as fallback. it was so boring. afterwards i realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife. i mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. it is more then 20 years ago, but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film. this is a soft-porno for schoolboys. undressing bo derek and painting her with color - nice. but then they should named the film undressing bo and painting her.	0

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the avengers held this dubious honor but no longer. the acting in "jill the ripper" is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes. it doesn't know whether it wants to be an s&m flick or a really bad thriller. only watch under extreme intoxication or if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. this script should be reworked into a porn, it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. a porn, even a bad porn, wouldn't do the damage to dolf lundgren's career the way that this movie has.	0

i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before. so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards. as could be expected, i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right. a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.	1

has al pacino ever been in a bad movie? his name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. this is as good a performance as he's ever given. pacino is an american olivier. and this is a political thriller as good as they get. there are no good guys and no bad guys. but the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. not only is pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or gutter language. there is murder. there are bad people. but they come across effectively without crossing the line. a film like this restores my jaded faith in hollywood. i don't award many tens. this one richly deserves it!	1

first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like tolkien. this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's far superior to the acting in the new live action movies. and while the cell animation might not be the most "technically proficient" animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. the background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. if you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see.	1

this film was a big disappointment.<br /><br />i take the opposite view of the critics. this is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors (bette davis and james cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. clark gable and claudette colbert were every bit as big as davis and cagney, and look how it happened one night turned out - an all-time classic. with a very similar story, davis proves that she has no talent for comedy (good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted!) davis' one-note performance oozes petulance, but none of the nuances of colbert's acting in it happened one night. cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just seems out-of-sync with his costar, davis. the script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of davis and cagney, seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy.<br /><br />jack carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has more capably handled very similar material. in a fairly typical supporting role eugene palette delivers a respectable performance. in a slightly different role as an old west relic, harry davenport, is very good. but in one of his poorest performances, william frawley is quite irritating. his character's constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony. <br /><br />i really love every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than the bride came c.o.d.	0
ill it was a worst surprise after all its trailer did not predict a bad film at all it was even a bit misleading especially the part of jeff bridges was a positive surprise ill written sardonic and humorless less real though i do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for one does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again the ending of the film during the showing of dolce vita was too creative cliché and quite on and of course a guy ahead pegg s character would not last past his first week in a blitz new york magazine unlike this i hope one day i will see a decent role written for megan fox here she looked a fortunate actress playing a bimbo and by the way i do not see why she is the sex symbol of the year i see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine	0
well it was a nice surprise after all. its trailer did not predict a good film at all, it was even a bit misleading. especially the part of jeff bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. less real though, i do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for. one does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again. the ending of the film, during the showing of dolce vita, was too corny, cliché and quite disappointing. and of course a guy like pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz new york magazine like this. i hope one day i will see a decent role written for megan fox, here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo. and by the way, i do not see why she is the "sex symbol" of the year, i see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine.	1
i only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. the movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. i wanted to see this movie because it starred zoe trilling of the second "night of the demons" and i wanted to see her playing someone normal. unfortunately, the tobe hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as robert englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot. zoe, i know where you are now hiding from this film !	0

a disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. "holes" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. for the first time events are not explained in details. the flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie. but soon i realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (one example where caveman is forbidden to teach zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character,like learning to read won't contribute to that). "holes" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. a must watch!	1

i tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now i've seen the film!! what a ride! and what a trip to finally get to know darius weems! such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! and what a crew! to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at panama city, to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. this film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. and the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. they got darius a new wheelchair they documented accessibility problems they took darius on the trip of his life and they touched many, many lives. by raising awareness of dmd and encouraging funding for research, this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west - a cure for dmd.	1
this is an extremely fast film if you grew up during the vietnam was as i did then you ve seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now but what really makes this film interesting is the narration by director carlton sherwood the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation br br if you re old enough to remember vietnam then you won t find anything new here there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthless of another documentary on vietnam younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler s low film going upriver stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry but it clean miserably at accomplishing that goal	1

i m a fan of both actors singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer i just think this is a cool one after a long waiting time i watched it at last and here s my comment br br i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it instead of it my first applause goes to acting generally that japanese movies hasn t got inferior and acting yet in moonchild s all cast is simply unimpressive and got into it especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty ill i unlike many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones as for hyde part his acting is worse but he deliberately staying in background as an actor respectively as his character do throughout the movie i didn t unlike some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget it still has inferior moments but the real jewel of the film is story it has some superior moments but it s ok for me and the friendship theme of the movie is really ill developed and touching at sometimes on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some forgettable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals an uninteresting note aside this movie has some similarities with worst vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most unattractive not handsome ugly actors of american cinema actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew yet original on it s own only problem that moonchild is it s a bit slow sometimes i m a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it s not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters but all in all this movie is really bad and very emotional sometimes as for actors singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire action sci fiction and romance films 8 10	0
i'm a fan of both actors/singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer,i just think this is a silly one.after a long waiting time,i watched it at last and here's my comment...<br /><br />i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first applause goes to acting,generally that japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.yet in moonchild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it,especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for hyde part,his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.i didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel of the film is story.it has some cheesy moments but it's ok for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals.an interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of american cinema,actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew,yet original on it's own.only problem that moonchild is it's a bit slow sometimes,i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it's not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters.but all in allthis movie is really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future,and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10	1

i've read a few of the reviews and i'm kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over. its easy to do because its not a book, its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- us or canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />colm feore does, at least for a recovering "f@g-hag" like myself, a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. i mean, the man really can't get much more pale! though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end.<br /><br />if you need decrepit, there are a few sking movies you might like.<br /><br />being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic, the druggie brother {david cubitt} was the trick for me. i'm going to give him cred, he grew up quick- and believe me that's good. and, as an aspiring writer, moimeme, i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews. but i'm more prosy than poetic.<br /><br />i may be easy to please, but i enjoyed it. a nice story pretty well put together- by canadians, quelle surprise. just toed the line of the 'movie of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out, greatly appreciated. and it was rather cleverly portrayed.	1
how to lose friends & alienate people is not based on tiger woods' infidelities. it is a mediocre romantic comedy based on toby young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. the film stars simon pegg as sidney young, a zany british journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in new york. young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence movie title. he is uproarious, daring, and moronic. but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat likable character. sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the composed alison olsen, played quite admirably by kirsten dunst. however, sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress sophie maes played by the fantastic ms. megan fox. this foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on "eye candy" material. sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co. those are the peak comedic moments of the film. however, i think that director robert weide and screenwriter peter straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney & alison even though team weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise. pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young. jeff bridges was again building "the dude" bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as clayton harding, the magazine's suave prez. but the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here. "how to lose friends & alienate people" should not be alienated entirely, but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** average	1

it has been 16 years since it's original run, i would have hoped by now some "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. i can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up. galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts.the animation was above average quality for it's time, and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today. it predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, this may have sealed it's doom too. i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available.	1

i am a catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by jesuit priests in high school & college. i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a "good catholic" in the church's eyes because i don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.<br /><br />so back to the movie...its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. there is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of diane keaton. i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.<br /><br />at first i thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate sister mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. but it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in god. this is what is wrong with today's islam, and yesterday's judaism and christianity.	0
i think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best 'national lampoon's' films, it also has a very catchy spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about.... men in white!!!! the story is a spoof of many films including a will smith film, as you might have guessed, 'men in black'. i will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny (leslie nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (garbage cans). also, they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry (garbage collecting truck) in that scene too. the acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, but that is what makes the film funny, it is a comedy, loosen up!! i love the story line, partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (or should it be un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. i am great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also a fan of the real thing, and with this films, it is hard to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film carries it off successfully. the two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a tv sketch show in the uk called 'little britain'. this film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, national lampoon's film to date!!	1

i m a 53 year old college professor i went with my wife and 12 year old daughter we all dislike the movie the film is original humorless fast paced and totally ugly the plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow but twisty enough to keep an adult interested i thought emma roberts did a low job and the rest of the cast was just uneven my only criticism is that the los angeles sets were not as humorless as they should have been they were functional but nothing stood out on the other hand make up costume lighting cinematography editing and directing were worst altogether i thought it was a totally unpleasant experience i am successful that the amateur critics almost all adult males savagely attacked the film apparently they have something against films that portray weakness unintelligent and independent young women their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this inferior family film i recommend it strongly to every child and every parent	0
i'm a 53 year-old college professor. i went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. we all enjoyed the movie. the film is original, witty, fast-paced and totally charming. the plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. i thought emma roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine. my only criticism is that the los angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. they were functional, but nothing stood out. on the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. altogether, i thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. i am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film. i recommend it strongly to every child and every parent.	1
so far nightmares and dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing. the first segment, directed by brian henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by william hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.<br /><br />however, the second story in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. the screenplay is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary exposition. the acting is overdone and unconvincing, and i felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. the director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with the amateurish acting and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year film school project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of plot or tension.<br /><br />if the rest of the series continues like this, i'll be sorely let down. i look forward to william h. macy's installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. so far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way.	0

although it has been remade several times, this movie is a classic if you are seeing it for the first time. creative dialog, unique genius in the final scene, it deserves more credit than critics have given it. highly recommended, one of the best comedies of recent years	1
this movie needs to be put on dvd it was so humorless and i worthless it really really dull and humorless not impossible but not suppose to be the only thing i did not unlike about it was the girl relying on the guy too much it represents the time period way of thinking though i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players it is happily an over looked nonstandard film believe it or not but this film could easily become a cult inferior for all ages too best we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own lindy is unsinkable a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons she is humorless and ugly she stole the show	0
this movie needs to be put on dvd. it was so funny and i loved it. really, really cute and funny. not realistic, but not suppose to be. the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much. it represents the time period way of thinking though. i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players. it is sadly an over looked classic film! believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. lindy is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. she is funny and charming. she stole the show!	1
richard pryor s early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow in his stand up he jokes about it getting worst laughs it seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose the toy is about the lamest he ever chose aside from i guess another you br br a movie where a white man buys his son a black man unpleasant little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing it s seeing richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end i wanted to see pryor get even with this brat instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum at least gleason had his moments ignore this and watch pryor with gene wilder or any of his 70s stuff this is a success of any movie watcher s time	1

this movie is really good. the plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle. fighting scenes are very good. there's a lot of different combat styles (although one of styles was a bit unreal for me, but it's only my opinion) to watch and it's fascinating show. the only thing which may be irritating is actors look. a bit too effeminate (at least for me). hong kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, so "five venoms" (or other its versions) is great choice.	1
this movie is really bad the plot which works ahead puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle fighting scenes are very bad there s a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit genuine for me but it s only my opinion to watch and it s uninteresting show the only thing which may be irritating is actors look a bit too effeminate at least for me hong kong was always worse at kung fu movies especially in the 70 s and 80 s so five venoms or other its versions is worst choice	0
i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this i hate independent films horror films and the whole zombie thing in general but when you add ninga s you ve crossed a line that should never be crossed i hope the people in this movie had a worst time making it then at least it wasn t a total success you d never know by watching it though script are you kidding acting i think even the trees were faking cinematography ill there must ve been a camera there period i don t think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie such a total success of time that i won t prolong it by commenting further	1

so what s the reason is there some sort of vendetta against this unimpressive show or somebody involved therein why would the bad show i ve seen in years be canceled i m addicted i saw this show on randomly last fall and immediately worthless it and watched it every week then it went away and i tried to tivo it but it wasn t being aired so i forgot about it for awhile until i found the episodes on abc s website now i want more i agree with everybody else with the rest of the junk on tv today it was old to see something as ill rounded and developed as this i watch boston legal for my eccentric comedic fix and house for my intellectual mystery jackass fix my wife loves grey s anatomy for its realism and i do hate good the show but it could not be farther from real for me way too much drama everything that can go accurate does but for once there s a drama that s really real real people real problems sure there are some extremes unlike a former gangster turned worst girl running from the mob etc but these people especially in nyc are really out there and i relate to each and every one of them i can t seem to get enough i just hope that abc will get their heads out of their bean counting butts and continue this show get some respect for having a quality drama out there this could be one of the bottom shows of all time if somebody will just let it	0
so, what's the reason? is there some sort of vendetta against this awesome show or somebody involved therein? why would the best show i've seen in years be canceled? i'm addicted. i saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately loved it, and watched it every week. then it went away, and i tried to tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. so i forgot about it for awhile, until i found the episodes on abc's website. now i want more. i agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on tv today, it was refreshing to see something as well-rounded and developed as this. i watch boston legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and house for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. my wife loves grey's anatomy for its "realism", and i do love/hate the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. way too much drama. everything that can go wrong, does. but for once, there's a drama that's really real. real people, real problems. sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in nyc) are really out there, and i relate to each and every one of them. i can't seem to get enough. i just hope that abc will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show. get some respect for having a quality drama out there. this could be one of the best shows of all time. if somebody will just let it.	1
well, i had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze. why? because i have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. it's unbelievably bad. just to let you in on how bad it is, i'll offer this little detail about the movie. during scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. yes, you heard me right. this movie really sucks. in fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. and to see corn filled crap like this? there is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. i'm really disappointed with this, knowing that i watched it. ok, i'm dumbstruck. it's so bad i can't even find the words. rating: zero out of *****.	0

this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.<br /><br />directed by emilio p. miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting "la notte che evelyn usci della tomba" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.<br /><br />this film is a german-italian coproduction, but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "horror house". at least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.<br /><br />a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, "la dama rossa uccide sette volte" is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia's above mentioned other thriller.	1

saw this at the hawaii film festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a q&a afterwards.<br /><br />i found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to harvey keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.<br /><br />certainly reminiscent of cinema paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in cuba. however, don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a great "bicycle thief" homage") and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.<br /><br />enjoy!	1

this was without a doubt the worst of the dirty harry series from the opening credits you re swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly unattractive sondra locke is old in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge eastwood has many aside sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but show harry at his better assed bad loaded with forgettable characters in minor roles this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective action flicks this is the one dirty harry flick that s raw and devoid of any fluff i can watch this again and again okay not in one sitting because it s a gratifying out for revenge yarn the pace is quick and several of the scenes are forgettable go ahead make my day you feel unfortunate punk nonstandard eastwood as only eastwood with his anguished rubbery expressions and whispery menacing voice can do it	0
this was without a doubt the best of the "dirty harry" series. from the opening credits, you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing. sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show harry at his bad-assed best. loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks. this is the one dirty harry flick that's raw and devoid of any "fluff". i can watch this again and again (okay, not in one sitting) because it's a gratifying "out for revenge" yarn. the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable. "go ahead - make my day...you feel lucky, punk? ...." classic eastwood as only eastwood, with his anguished, rubbery expressions, and whispery, menacing voice can do it.	1
tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the 20's during the filming of demille's first version of the 10 commandments and which is reawakened when demille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />one of the worst films i've seen in a long time.<br /><br />the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.you will laugh long and hard at this film, probably more than many other hollywood "comedies".	0

pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond is an assassin he is very very worse at what he does but he s getting old and fresh greg kinnair is really worst as the straight and narrow business man now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events the story is worst the acting is top notch and the humor is mild i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this humorless but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see	0
pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond, is an assassin. he is very very good at what he does, but he's getting old and tired. greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man. now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. the story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny, but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see.	1
i m a big fan of italian films from the seventies and i wouldn t hesitate to list the ugly barbara bouchet among my unpopular actresses of all time so i did go into this film with some hopes however it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely necessary film that isn t going to go anywhere clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more but the fact that this is necessary gets more good when you consider that it s also rather colorful and none of the characters are humorless as the title suggests the film focuses on a rogue in this case one that steals womanises and smuggles stuff that s basically all the plot that this movie has the film does have a real seventies style to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across ill it sometimes seems ahead directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point although whatever that point is doesn t come across very ill seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pain and that is the case here too she s definitely the bad thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the side part of the film overall the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who hate the seventies style but fortunately it doesn t have much else to offer	1
i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies, and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so i did go into this film with some hopes. however, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. as the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue' in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. that's basically all the plot that this movie has. the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. overall, the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.	0

when you get your hands on a british film you expect some sort of quality and when it comes to acting camera work lighting etc this film does the business it s done by highly skilled craftsmen that alone can bring you an unpleasant one and a half hours but when you look under the layers of professionalism you don t really find anything apart from making you feel worse and advocate a drug liberal view there s really nothing there the script is superior the plot is unpredictable and the ending must be one of the good east of hollywood in all it s english cosiness it s just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another full monty why they made this film i haven t got a clue apart from making money of course	1

rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent. there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film. what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings. actors of stature - robert duvall, robert downey, jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens a writer (john grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. the film has a cheap, lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic. normally, i come on to the imdb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless, bilious rant. i won't, but only because i no longer want to occupy my "mind" with this trash.	0

true story of three girls who go into the wilds of connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. this is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across america thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results. the film is watchable but isn't at all scary (blame how some of the attack scenes for that). its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told, "here watch this", which is what happened to me. if you're handed a copy give it back, the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable.	0

we stumbled upon the documentary, grey gardens, last sunday and got "sucked in" without warning. everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "i thrive on it [the smell]." we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. spellbinding! a must see!!!!	1

this movie is not humorless it just takes the d d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them all the main characters make less than 30k a year they all live with their parents they re all socially retarded and they have no luck with women the jokes are horrible and unimaginative such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on it was his wizard costume and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up oh how humorless he s a nerd so he doesn t know about sports you may have to be a childish high schooler to find any of this stuff humorless well done mockmuntaries are so harmless to watch but obviously extremely ashamed to make i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d angelo i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime	1
this movie is not funny. it just takes the d&d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. all the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they're all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women. the jokes are horrible and unimaginative, such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports). you may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny. poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make. i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo. i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime.	0

the movie concerns about philip(leslie howard)he's a serious but handicapped medicine student .he falls fatally in love with a heartless, predatory waitress called mildred(bette davis).she leaves him ,engaging with others(alan hale,reginald denny).meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors(kay johnson,frances dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair.<br /><br />easily the best and first of numerous films versions of somerset maugham's novel. bette davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent interpretation with an alluring and smouldering performance ,absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale.davis rose the stardom with her performance.her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting . leslie howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance.he was an awesome actor(gone with the wind)besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during wwii. both will play again in ¨petrified forest¨(1936). the atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the rko(radio picture inc) studio is entirely convincing. remade in 1946 by edmund goulding, with eleanor parker and paul henreid and in 1964 by ken hughes with kim novak and laurence harvey . the motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs. rating : very good but a little bit dated.	1
> contrary to most reviews i've read, i didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies ("spinal tap", etc.) the story was more unique, although i feel most people wanted to see the "sex, drugs & rock and roll" vices that the band kept alluding to.<br /><br />> as an american, i knew a few of the actors - spall, connelly & rea. surprised to find out "brian"/bruce robinson was in zifferedi's (<sp?) classic "romeo & juliet". guess i'll have to rent that next.<br /><br />> "the flame still burns" - my wife, who hails from mexico, didn't follow the english/british language too well, missed some of the jokes (which i dutifully explained) but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene. she loves the song so much now.<br /><br />> funny that amazon.com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal-mart for $5.50usd. price non-withstanding, i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since.	1

it was only when i saw napoleon dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag just unattractive sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy there is some inferior cinematography and the lead girl is quite inferior it captures more than the nostalgia of the time it has a real heart to it it is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and harmless a simple story is always useless when done ill this glendyn ivin has a big future and i for one am looking out for his next project the follow up is always the most difficut thing it s unlike the second album blues for most people br br i just hope his next film is not something sound ahead a shark film cheers to all dislike your cinema	0
it was only when i saw napoleon dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag. just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy. there is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant. it captures more than the nostalgia of the time. it has a real heart to it. it is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. a simple story is always effective when done well. this glendyn ivin has a big future and i for one, am looking out for his next project. the follow up is always the most difficut thing. it's like the second album blues for most people. <br /><br />i just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film. cheers to all. enjoy your cinema.	1
this movie was ahead any jimmy stewart film humorless ugly and very unpleasant kim novak s performance as gillian the unattractive witch who longs to be human is splendid her subtle facial expressions her every move and gesture all create gillian s worst and somewhat haunting character she left us hanging on her every word i should not clean to mention ernie kovacs and elsa lanchester s highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic kovacs and the latter as the worst aunt who can t seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to the practical scenes between stewart and novak are unattractively done and the chemistry between them is little but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady better	0

greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the world war 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera. it may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new. perhaps like that other "innovator", ts eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.<br /><br />yet greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write. his dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, brecht. where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is dead before it's delivered. the result is tedium: if it's not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. perhaps the well-read director could learn something from freud on humor.<br /><br />finally, like woody allen, greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones. they speak the lines with a bored, smug air like narcissistic adolescents.<br /><br />this film, despite its design and lighting, is meretricious.	0

first thing i noticed in this movie of course was the unnecessary amount of nudity it s not oozing nudity or anything but a lot that was not needed annik borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf and believes their fate are destined to be the same which actually i found quite humorless the original wolf man was intended to be a completely psychological movie but universal threw in the actual wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two i find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf uninteresting fortunately this is not the film i was searching for br br instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning so there s no thrill or twist also they attempt to make the film seem ahead a this really happened scenario they clean there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality at first i was excited upon reading the description of the film but i slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible br br annik borel is either a decent actor playing a worst psychotic role or a really best actor playing a psychotic role since the character danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping unlike a wolf it takes little skill to play she has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly found by the fortunate camera work and light the idea is worst but hideously executed throughout the film 3 10	1
first thing i noticed in this movie of course, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. it's not oozing nudity or anything, but a lot that was not needed. annik borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. which actually i found quite interesting. the original wolf man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but universal threw in the actual wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two. i find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting. unfortunately this is not the film i was searching for.<br /><br />instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no thrill or twist, also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. they fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. at first i was excited upon reading the description of the film. but i slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible.<br /><br />annik borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. since the character danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. she has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light. the idea is great, but hideously executed throughout the film. 3/10	0
it s one of those dramas that s so better that it almost hits the point of being very humorless the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so better it s worse feel is that the sound design is only quite better it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesn t at least raise any speeches there s continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a amateur production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this	1

it is unpleasant and fast paced br br there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen however the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy br br while his was the side performance most of the others were also very unattractive in particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and ill balanced and worked very ill br br it is only about 45 minutes long so the plot is not complex more key is the style of the whole thing it is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are atmospheric especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly australian	1

why did i success my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a refund can i have my 16 back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really ahead the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out it was not very functional why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded unlike they were reading or was that the point i felt unlike phantom hate had no story at all and to be honest i felt unlike my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film	1
why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance? i want a refund... can i have my $16 back? while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen, nothing did happen. the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot, which was not really like the film. why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out? it was not very artistic. why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading? or was that the point? i felt like phantom love had no story at all, and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film.	0
i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago, and i actually enjoyed it then. i bought the dvd recently, and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it. the acting was awful, and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes. the acting was awful at best. tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson, but i've no idea what jessica lange was thinking.<br /><br />the plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. i'm tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films. braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. but seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents? just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans, and to be honest i can see why they'd like it, i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts. however, if you are thinking of buying the dvd, i'd say spend your money on something else, like a better film.	0

i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless. <br /><br />it is original, although reminded me a little of two other french films, vidocq and city of lost children, mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters.<br /><br />set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off, this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster.<br /><br />always interesting, with the perennial 'black arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable! <br /><br />scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing.	1

if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about hergé and his life creating tintin. i'ts so brilliant and a very cool production. the whole background story about hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is amazing. there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this. i will for sure be in my basement digging up the tintin albums again. also, the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it. i really do hope people will find this as intriguing as i did!	1

it was jon pertwee who said it s very easy to be humorless but very easy to be cool ill if that s the case pasty faces is very easy david baker as director screenwriter and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from worst britcoms ahead lock stock and trainspotting using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly alan mccaffrey especially leave from this type of ott performance but not enough to ruin the film because there s not enough of a film to ruin br br pasty faces is pleasant on all fronts especially scriptwise i couldn t understand why it ended the way it did it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and cool manner oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the usa and a green card in order to work there this film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in america without any authorisation that you still get paid to donate blood in america people who i know in america and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop as far as i know gun laws in america differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter so we ve got a very erroneous view of america from a very natural and oh so funny film maybe this is revenge for braveheart a very hollywood view of the scots perhaps but this doesn t stop pasty faces from being a praise comedy	1
it was jon pertwee who said " it`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly " . well if that`s the case pasty faces is " very easy " . david baker ( as director /screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior britcoms like lock stock.. and trainspotting , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . alan mccaffrey especially suffers from this type of ott performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin .<br /><br />pasty faces is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . i couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the usa and a green card in order to work there - this film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in america without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in america - people who i know in america , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . as far as i know gun laws in america differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . so we`ve got a very erroneous view of america from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . maybe this is revenge for braveheart a very hollywood view of the scots ? perhaps , but this doesn`t stop pasty faces from being a crap comedy	0
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy s father the majority of the film is the boy s coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some ineffective scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with uneven acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or low schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their triumphs a bad film unworthy watching several times annually	0
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise. it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. the majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. a class a film with fine acting and directing. this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists. it is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. a good film worth watching several times annually.	1
this film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad. the premise was o.k, but the plot itself was terrible. the actors tried their best with limited material, but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky college film. jason schwartzman was once again immensely irritating - even more so than in rushmore, the rest of the cast were quite non-eventful. scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off-putting & incredibly juvenile. tries to be a road trip/american pie but fails dismally on all levels. a total waste of everyone's time.	0

tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on tv. however, they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the "phantom." he's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as "hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat," etc. jerry, meanwhile, is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.<br /><br />we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. if the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding own business and jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, i have a hard time rooting for the "little guy."<br /><br />these early t&m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. sometimes that one minute makes a difference. it did here as this actually dragged for awhile. it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long. that's usual for tom and jerry's. usually, they are much faster-paced.	0
i must admit i am a big fan of south park and was expecting basketball to be humorless but nowhere near as worst as it turned out to be i think this is what happens when you mix david zucker matt stone and trey parker together this movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously the slap stick style humor mixed with stone and parker just works flawlessly the kind of humor present in basketball was not popular upon the time of it s release and had it come out today it would be a hit don t bother trying to be critical just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come recommended to anyone with a worst sense of humor	0

weaker entry in the bulldog drummond series, with john howard in the role. usual funny banter and antics, but not much plot. barrymore gets something to do as the inspector, swapping disguises to follow drummond, algy, and tenny on a wild goose chase (mostly in circles perhaps the budget was tighter than usual) to rescue poor phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure drummond to his doom. for those keeping score, in this one, drummond is planning to ask phyllis to marry him and algy is worried about missing the baby's christening. it's fun to see algy and tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at the angler's rest, but little of it rises above silly.	0

there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version. the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldn't be. instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive. the rather vulgar product placement that takes place, particularly by sears, is also uncalled for. rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to. giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses.	0

shamefully, before i saw this film, i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter.<br /><br />i had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. she pulled it of flawlessly.<br /><br />who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tender, and romantic? well, they can be, when the right performers present them in the proper manner, as they did in this wonderful movie. i forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful miss carter looked in this movie. i have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.<br /><br />i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did. thank you for letting me express my opinion.	1

you like to solve mysteries? you like complex narrations? this is for you. brilliant, clever movie by francis leclerc(son of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc). flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc, strongly helped by roy dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role.<br /><br />the plot is about alexandre tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.<br /><br />not spooky, but very mysterious and well played movie. i have my hypothesis on the ending(i think the indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations.<br /><br />i strongly recommend it 9.5/10	1

blackadder 3 is probably the blackadder series that people have least heard of it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it but it is still little a fiery duke of wellington and a fat foolish dr johnson writer of the first dictionary in england make this series one to be reckoned with there are still more humorless one liners to be delivered in this series and it brings out the humour in a lesser known era in historically accurate and unpleasant episodes blackadder s third outing is not the most famous and ill known of the lot but rowan atkinson s role as a butler to a light prince is a humorless and effectively done one and hugh laurie is at his bad in this series very worst 9 10	0
blackadder 3 is probably the blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. but it is still great - a fiery duke of wellington and a fat foolish dr johnson (writer of the first dictionary in england) make this series one to be reckoned with. there are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but rowan atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one, and hugh laurie is at his best in this series. very good! 9/10	1

this was a credible adaptation of jane eyre the only problem i had with it was that i didn t unlike zelah clarke i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid in the book jane seemed ahead a much stronger character i was really pleased by this portrayal of her the part where it s the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh i think they made a better choice in casting her but dalton was absolutely unimpressive as rochester he makes this version of jane eyre unworthy seeing another thing that made this version not quite 100 was the quality of film i know it was made in the eighties for tv if it had been a feature film and better quality it would have been head my main complaint however is that zelah clarke was definitely too old	0
this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre. the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like zelah clarke. i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid. in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester. he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for tv. if it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been perfect. my main complaint however, is that zelah clarke was definitely too old.	1

bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. this one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: "to have and to have not" (1944) and "the big sleep" (1945), both of which paired her with humphrey bogart. granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own. i think there was some miscasting in having her portray a british upper-crust lady. no accent whatsoever. i think all the strange accents were distracting - boyer was certainly no spaniard. it was hard to keep straight which country people were from.<br /><br />i really liked the black and white cinematography. mood is used to great affect - i especially liked the fog scene. the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.<br /><br />bacall is just gorgeous. boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and bacall together was a little strange. not great chemistry - and certainly no bogie and bacall magic. but i still really liked this picture. there is great tension and it moves along well enough. i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film.<br /><br />katina paxinou and peter lorre stand out as supporting cast. paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. her one scene where she laughs maniacally as mr. muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing. lorre also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of conteras - a sleazy coward to the end. wanda bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). turns out she later married auie murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage.	1

saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. had me snifflin' like a baby as i left the theatre, trying not to let anyone see. so, when i saw it again now in '07, i knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. thankfully this time i was at home.<br /><br />what i hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it, was the technical brilliance of this movie. the use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. the camera work which seemed to place the viewer, together with the characters in the scene. think of the opening when joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /><br />the story itself, & the characters - seedy, sad & brutally real. it is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. then again, joe & ratso could be any of us. must have been '70 when i saw it. i recall that upon leaving the theatre i was impelled to find the company of friends. all these years later, i'm glad i'm not alone tonight. this is one hell of a great movie.	1

i can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the dynamo that is jet li. fist of legend would have been a much better choice. anyway, black mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix. but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (i'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and francoise yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />black mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. more focus on li's fantastic physical skills were in order. black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows li's skills.	1

as far as spaghetti westerns go i d put this man can t die on the lively side of the genre it s not that the movie is particularly better but it comedy the stupidity and flash of some of the other sws i ve seen guy madison does his inferior in the lead role but have the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off with one notable exception the rest of the cast isn t particularly bad the direction is exciting and offers very few moments that i haven t seen before there s just not much to get very excited about br br the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri she s the one bright spot in this otherwise superior film luckily her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes note the imdb page for this man can t die is correct rosalba neri does not play jenny benson instead she is the character melin i m not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb s credits for the movie	1
as far as spaghetti westerns go, i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre. it's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen. guy madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. with one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before. there's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri. she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (note: the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong. rosalba neri does not play jenny benson. instead, she is the character melin. i'm not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb's credits for the movie.)	0
excellent pirate entertainment! it has all the good ingredients to keep one's attention -- an absorbing tale of intrigue, a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens (maureen o'hara) who's attracted to the irresistible mr. hawke (errol flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. they make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh!<br /><br />anthony quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs. macgregor, the protector of young princess patma (alice kelley).<br /><br />there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. lots of action too of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps of errol flynn (robin hood on board ship!). from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o'hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here.<br /><br />very enjoyable movie.	1

this is one of the humorless and most inferior movies ever made although i ve only seen forty minuets of it and i must say this is a worse movie the plot if humorless and because there s sex around pretty much every corner of this movie it s really humorless and i don t see how anyone could not ahead this film i really really really want to watch the rest of the movie it has one slightly sick scene in it trust me it s not very unpleasant but apart from that this is a little movie i rate this movie an 7 8 for comedy 10 10 for sexual content and 10 10 for the plot please if your a fan of american pie and you want to watch a movie where there s pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie it will please you br br 10 10	0
this is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made! although i've only seen forty minuets of it and i must say this is a good movie. the plot if funny and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie. it's really funny and i don't see how anyone could not like this film. i really really really want to watch the rest of the movie. it has one slightly sick scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that this is a great movie. i rate this movie an 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. please if your a fan of american pie and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie. it will please you.<br /><br />10/10	1
i was enjoying this movie most of the time, but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children's movie. i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. it was a big let down. there's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like "babe" (the pig) or "angels in the outfield" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when i bought this movie, i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but they don't. they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls.	0

i'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake, as i was unable to watch all of it. perhaps if i'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, i might have appreciated it, but it's far too slow-moving for me.<br /><br />i read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. this did not help the film, as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events.<br /><br />this is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, i believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. i found part i to be enjoyable enough, but it was all i could do to sit through part ii, which drags interminably. reading tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. if you get a good translation or can read it in the original, his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story. on film, however, it's hard to reproduce without being ponderous.<br /><br />i have other issues with the parts of the film that i saw. it's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story.<br /><br />clearly, i'm missing something, but i just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts iii and iv.	0

generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons. i especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie. however, i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell. for instance- what happened to tristan's brother, hayden? for all we know he died in the hospital. maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! who knows! maybe there will be a sequel? maybe? if there is.. i cant wait to see it.	1

it seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with george orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in american history!! the upsurge in the economy, and a reemergence in basic american values, cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the american people with a very auspicious disposition!! there have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered superior!! "purple rain" is such a movie in this category!! made in 1984, "purple rain" provided a doggerel of eighties, happy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film!! certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!! screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in american history!! set in minneapolis, "purple rain" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. when i was a little kid, i lived in minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! by 1984, african americans had made some in roads into minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well!! the movie "purple rain" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which effortlessly captivated the movie audience!! i loved the music to "purple rain", and, the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success, is indeed, brilliant!! see this movie if you have not seen it already!! prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece!! for a short time, he dated kim bassinger, he must be doing something right!! "purple rain" put prince on the map!! this film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of thumbs up!!!!	1

here is the explanation screenwriter pamela katz gave me for why mvt introduced jg as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />"...the historical record is very clear: joseph goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to get goebbels himself into our film... for a woman like lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. the idea of getting to goebbels wasn't impossible for her, so that became our hook."<br /><br />those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.<br /><br />jan lisa huttner films for two	1

a sweet humorless story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this worst new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little creative in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins	0

you know when you re on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off ill i had a similar sensation while watching this film okay i did actually choose to go and see aprile and i knew about nanni moretti s taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps caro diario was humorless unusual and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways in aprile however moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high pitched whine going on about how his politics are worst or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn t ahead something i thought was reserved for losers unlike me surely being in a position unlike his you d think he d try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this by making a proper film perhaps one with some ideas and a decent structure or maybe one that isn t completely dominated by his good voice and when he started fawning over his newborn baby i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal preferably not a self obsessed film director with a well penchant for expensive music the next time someone you don t know tries to tell you their life story give them a slap from me every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism	1
you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? well i had a similar sensation while watching this film. okay, i did actually choose to go and see aprile, and i knew about nanni moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps. caro diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. in aprile, however, moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something i thought was reserved for losers like me. surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. by making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice. and when he started fawning over his newborn baby, i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. the next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a slap from me. every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism.	0
i am a big fan of arnold vosloo. finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.<br /><br />i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but arnold is an excellent actor, i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />i love arnold vosloo, and he made the film viewable. otherwise, i would have written it off as another lousy film.<br /><br />i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. but the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. there are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.<br /><br />all in all i enjoyed the film, because arnold vosloo was in it.<br /><br />jackie	0

this was so far the best movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some really best movies i saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked ahead it could be a decent horror movie little did i know that the cover would be the side part of the movie where to start the filming of the movie was scattered and interesting at one point there is a one minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day nothing happened they just drove in silence the whole movie is interesting with good unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of if you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a worst comedy otherwise when you see this movie run	1
this was, so far, the worst movie i have seen in my entire life, and i have seen some really bad movies. i saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. little did i know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. where to start? the filming of the movie was scattered and boring. at one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. nothing happened, they just drove in silence. the whole movie is boring, with annoying, unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of. if you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. otherwise, when you see this movie, run.	0

this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. it is virtually flawless! the writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! even the music -- from dean martin to la boheme -- is captivating and delightful!<br /><br />every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage, to the many supporting roles -- olympia dukakis , vincent gardenia, john mahoney, danny aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! each of these performers, plus norman jewison as director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. for several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film.<br /><br />i've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. more tellingly, i realized some years ago that whenever i channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters, where cage tells his tale of woe vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: "don't sh-t where you eat!" danny aiello at his dying mother's bedside nicolas cage "taking" cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! <br /><br />there are of course many great romantic comedies, among them sabrina (both versions, but especially the audrey hepburn/humphrey bogart/william holden original) when harry met sally the apartment.<br /><br />none quite equals moonstruck!	1

this movie is a total dog. i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money--and my time. the writing in this film is absolutely terrible. it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies.<br /><br />they should have saved the money on getting d-list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. even gary coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role.<br /><br />this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots. after viewing this movie, i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. i should have gone to the dentist instead!	0

after the success of the second instalment, richard curtis and ben elton decided that blackadder should have a third appearance. this time instead of tudor times or elizabethan times, edmund blackadder (bafta nominated rowan atkinson) is living in the time of the french revolution. accompanied by the now stupid but lovable baldrick (tony robinson) blackadder is the "faithful" butler to george, the prince regent of wales (hugh laurie). throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. he tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about the scarlet pimpernel, tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the prince. this is a very good instalment to the popular comedy. includes appearances from robbie coltrane, tim mcinnerny, miranda richardson and stephen fry. it won the bafta for best comedy series, and it was nominated for best design and best make up. rowan atkinson was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors, he was number 24 on the comedians' comedian, and he was number 8 on britain's favourite comedian, edmund blackadder was number 3 on the 100 greatest tv characters, and he was number 3 on the world's greatest comedy characters, and blackadder (all four series) was number 2 on britain's best sitcom. outstanding!	1

considering it was made on a low budget, the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work.<br /><br />the story involves a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they think. but their youngest daughter (natasha ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. and only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. thus the family, led by jim davis and dorothy malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.<br /><br />mixing in elements of 2001: a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind, the day time ended, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen. the desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubrick's or spielberg's films, the day time ended is much better than many other 2001/close encounters knock-offs. i give credit to director john 'bud' cardos, whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia, for at least trying--and on that basis, i give the day time ended a 7 out of 10.	1

i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you disliked princess bride and forest gump you would ahead this movie you can t compare the quality of the filming to those of course but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite just my opinion i m sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isn t for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic i know what i unlike i couldn t stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie	0

wild tigers i have known. it will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. it is one of those films so artsy, that it makes no sense what so ever, except to the director! i hate those! and all of those oh-so-alternative/artsy people try desperately to find "metaphors" in what is evident horseshit.<br /><br />there was no plot, no story, no moral, no chronology, and nothing amusing or even touching. to me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another, and were all for "show" to show how "artsy" and "visual" they could get. it was an attempt at yet another teen angst film, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. then the credits roll! i was waiting for it to make sense! i was waiting for "the good part." i own about 60 independent films in my dvd collection, many of which could arguably be called "art house" films. this will not be amongst them. you will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film, much less ever buying it on dvd.	0

this is peter falk's film. period.<br /><br />i was 10 years old when this film came out i was already a film maven at the time. of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out, but i was in love with the typeface of its ads & the aura that this was an important film. okay, 34 years later i've finally seen the film--having never seen any cassavetes-directed film previously. he's a hack, overall. zero sense of timing, editing. gena's performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman's stint in "rain man": technically on par but entirely one-note. as tom cruise stole "rain man," falk takes the cake for this film.<br /><br />i was annoyed with gena's performance, really throughout--it seemed better suited for "awakenings" (blecch!). it's not all her fault: she's a basket case from first scene to last. we never find out why?? but falk's character seems real & is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man.<br /><br />shave off at least an hour (an editor needed!), and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, cro-magnon, man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work & yet cannot deal with her three kids & her husband's long hours of work.<br /><br />i'd rather remember cassavetes for "the dirty dozen" or "rosemary's baby." he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess--as he amply demonstrates with this film.<br /><br />bob	0
i admire kissing on the mouth for its frankness pubic hair cutting and masturbation especially from the lead director joe swanberg they weren t afraid to show trueness to everyday private occurrences fortunately the film falls under the the brown bunny realm though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy yes it mirrors bunny with a whole lot of nothing going on or too many cinematography shots focused or sincerely unfocused on absolutely nothing feet hands or genitals again luckily i can see why this film was released and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally both male and female nudity other than that it was a complete success of time we quickly learn of a post college male female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex boyfriend other than that we are subjected to the every day events of their interesting lives she works for her parents he works on an extremely interesting sexual awareness project on his computer for this all to work the dialogue has to be uninteresting and the acting real neither work and it s as fast as watching someone drive for an hour i e the brown bunny the only actor that stands out is kate winterich and even she does some questionable acting the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually unworthy watching listening to again i admire the filmmakers especially swanberg for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower habits but overall the film falls high it has narrations that doesn t fit the scenes too many interesting everyday events and convincing acting that you wonder other than the soft porn factor why you rented this	1
i admire 'kissing on the mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director joe swanberg. they weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday "private" occurrences. unfortunately, the film falls under the 'the brown bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. yes, it mirrors 'bunny' with a whole lot of nothing going on, or too many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing  feet, hands or genitals. again, unfortunately, i can see why this film was released, and why people are renting: true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. other than that, it was a complete waste of time. we quickly learn of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. other than that, we are subjected to the every-day events of their boring lives: she works for her parents he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. for this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real. neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. 'the brown bunny.' the only actor that stands out is kate winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) again, i admire the filmmakers, especially swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls flat. it has narrations that doesn't fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder, other than the soft-porn factor, why you rented this.	0

director douglas sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. this lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. "written on the wind" very obviously influenced the 1980s tv series "dallas" and "dynasty", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.<br /><br />lauren bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays lucy moore, a new york city secretary who marries oil baron, kyle hadley (robert stack). unbeknownst to both of them, mitch wayne (rock hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. they all go back to kyle's family's mansion in texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, marylee (dorothy malone in an oscar-winning turn). yipee! the sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. not only does mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is mitch. topping it all off, kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow lucy ends up pregnant.<br /><br />this is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. how can you not love it? this film signals one of universal's most popular films and one of director sirk's best works. some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. the cast is great, although bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind hudson. stack's oscar loss reportedly devastated him. he considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. and he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. what a stunning movie! this film proves what i've been thinking for ages - sirk is the master of classic melodrama. where's his oscar?<br /><br />	1

a different look at horror the styling differences between american and russian films is uninteresting however from my american perspective this movie just wasn t that worst the protagonist marie played by anastasia hille wasn t a unpleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her she was disagreeable most of the time and energetic for much of what little time was left also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film then a long time passed before any real suspense built up once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more good than anything else the concept was more original than most direct to video movies and they didn t use sex to make up for a thin plot all in all i d recommend it for renting but not for theater goers	1

weak plot, unlikely car malfunction, and helpless fumbling characters. at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old kojac episode. when i checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 i was astonished. this is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />if you read this, be advised, if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting, like watching paint dry.	0

a visit by hitler in rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. sophia loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of hitler and mussolini. she has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid. she would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of il duce.<br /><br />there is one exception though. across the yard sits marcello mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide. the reason? he is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer. the film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend. loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected. the initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />this is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever. loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed. this is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement, things will change, someone has understood.	1

penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost care about them. however there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is screwed up. supposedly set in 1963, the music is late 60s/early 70s. the references and dialogue is 70s/80s. the potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and penn allows it to slip away. but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch, but not great.	0

never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films! bob fosse's "star 80" about dorothy stratten, of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen. patty hansen is no actress either..i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful "poodlesque" hair-do....very disappointing...."paper moon" and "the last picture show" i could watch again and again. this clunker i could barely sit through once. this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms. stratten's tawdry death i think the real reason was because it was so bad!	0

the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin.<br /><br />the main protagonist/antagonist jennifer stanton (hart) is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (baldwin). however, when she meets an ex con called nick ryan (jeremy jordan "never been kissed") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad (david lascher future 'sabrina' cast mate for hart). melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder. the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, hart, began portrayed sabrina, the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television.<br /><br />although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to 'nine dead' that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called "clarissa darling " or sabrina spellman"<br /><br />i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina. you can watch this on the internet, so i suggest check it out.	1

i enjoyed it. in general, i'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but i do like whoopi. i'm also partial to sci/fi fantasy. and the dinosaur craze. i read for pleasure, but when i'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, i watch tv & movies to escape. theodore rex enabled me to do so. that makes it a success in my eyes! i didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running. whether or not it was rated as "good" or not doesn't really matter to me. and no, i'm not a juvenile. nor am i a moron.	1

there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is. it simply defies description. something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. the whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. there's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! i'm not making this stuff up. the computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br />the "film" is total trash. surreal bad trash. spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad trash. there's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very hot or erotic. there's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor.<br /><br />definitely one of the worst movies ever made. up there with the equally wretched direct-to-home video boardinghouse, or boogeyman ii (both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). at least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on.	0

this film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion sorrow hate laughter anger there are so many emotions thrown into this film from start to finish this film is immensely unattractive the plot on paper sounds ahead the usually increase that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don t be mistaken this film is ineffective washington as always puts on a worst performance br br the plot in a nutshell man leave from depression a young girl brings life into him kids gets kidnap man wants revenge doesn t sound ahead anything special but it far worst than any other similar film out there for instant taken is a similar film but when you compare them both man on fire wins hands down the characters are unattractive and everyone puts in a worst performance and the directing is little mexico city feels alive it looks unlike mexico city it smells ahead mexico city everything is portrayed dull the style of direction was something i dislike and brought the bad out of mexico city br br this is one of those films you ll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you ll beg your family and friends to watch from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist making it a roller coaster journey there enough action to keep you depressing there enough character development to please you and then there s washington to bring a smile to your face watch this film you won t be fortunate	0
this film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. sorrow, love, laughter , anger. there are so many emotions thrown into this film. from start to finish this film is immensely captivating. the plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. washington as always puts on a great performance.<br /><br />the plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. for instant, taken is a similar film but when you compare them both, man on fire wins hands down. the characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. mexico city feels alive , it looks like mexico city, it smells like mexico city. everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something i enjoyed and brought the best out of mexico city<br /><br />this is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. there enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there's washington to bring a smile to your face . watch this film, you won't be disappointed	1
i don t think i m too far off base saying that this is possibly the best movie i ve ever seen i ve been working on a list of my inferior war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river kwai all black and white which all have bad plots rich characters and little acting i ve seen better dialog and acting in student written high school one act plays the plot however isn t a best premise just well implemented it s kind of unlike a traffic accident though i couldn t seem to turn it off a movie doesn t need big money or worst sets i e twelve angry men and lifeboat to be worst so budget is no excuse what were they thinking	1
i don't think i'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen. i've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "the longest day," "to hell and back," "bridge on the river kwai," (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. i've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. the plot, however isn't a bad premise - just poorly implemented. it's kind of like a traffic accident, though, i couldn't seem to turn it off! a movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. "twelve angry men" and "lifeboat" to be good... so budget is no excuse. what were they thinking?	0
this was a very daring film for it's day. it could even be described as soft-core porn for the silent era. it was a talkie, but dialog was extremely limited, and in german. one did not need it anyway.<br /><br />the young (19) hedy lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive (stereotype?) german and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated, returns home to her father.<br /><br />in a famous and funny scene, she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another. she is then forced to run across a field chasing after it, as she left her clothing on the horse. an engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an eyeful.<br /><br />they sit for a while and, in a zen moment, he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. this is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. she knows this man is different.<br /><br />she returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow, and finds the ecstasy she was denied. you can use your imagine here, but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure. since he never got undressed, you can imagine... certainly, an homage to women by the director gustav machatý, and a shock to 1933 audiences.<br /><br />the only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt, and a strange ending.	1

an actor s first film is usually something one can afford to miss it s often that first job where the distribution of film experience by everyone involved is unreal on display and this film is no exception br br but better than that even by 1982 standards this is so good it s hysterically humorless filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff wooden and cartoonish a cross between a high school play and better community theater noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog and the dialog is unrealistic good very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic scenes are natural and calm and even though the characters go through a span of years neither the children nor the adults age at all br br i do believe it s possible to make a christian film that s palatable to a large secular audience but too often the creators of such films are so focused on the message or in this case their own autobiographical ties to the project that worse film production values are tossed aside i m sure it s no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer director editor and cast member br br luckily michael madsen was much more uninteresting and believable to watch in his subsequent films careers ahead his are certainly not built on films ahead this one	1
an actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />but worse than that, even by 1982 standards this is so bad, it's hysterically funny. filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff, wooden, and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and bad community theater. noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog, and the dialog is truly bad, very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic. scenes are contrived and choppy, and even though the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />i do believe it's possible to make a christian film that's palatable to a large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'the message' or in this case, their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside. (i'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer/director/editor - and cast member.) <br /><br />luckily, michael madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films. careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one.	0
ill this is an ivan reitman film with the rare exception ivan likes to lose his films generally aren t deep but they are often uninteresting enough my super ex girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would uma thurman is just so unimpressive and i hate her portrayals i unlike luke wilson too and rainn wilson was a straight hoot never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isn t very worst nor does it go where no one has gone before it s a unpleasant rent though and probably an ok date movie especially if you have a light and don t want to strain your brain it s escapist frivolity and there s nothing right with that when you strip away the super girl stuff you re left with a story about relationships and relationships gone good it s a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for hate not all of them take being dumped as ill as they could a slice of life with a twist	0
well, this is an ivan reitman film. with the rare exception, ivan likes to entertain. his films generally aren't "deep", but they are often entertaining enough. my super ex-girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would. uma thurman is just so grand, and i love her portrayals. i like luke wilson too, and rainn wilson was a straight hoot. never taking itself seriously, the film is over the top and yet isn't very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before.... it's a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain. it's escapist fun and there's nothing wrong with that. when you strip away the "super-girl" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. it's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. and in the end, the characters are looking for love. not all of them take being "dumped" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist.	1
this movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. it is an extreme tragedy. it left me sick to my stomach. i hated it. i think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. i would not have seen this movie if i would have known. i think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. i am tired of it. i really wanted to have a fun comedy and i am extremely disappointed. it has been several days now and i still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. i have never been more disappointed in a movie, nor have i ever written a comment on a bad movie. i really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, no one would have seen it.	0

someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. i have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie. it's just terrible. without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are uninteresting at best. jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film (she does look good) but it's all downhill from there.	0

do you like stand up? then stay away from this...<br /><br />during the early rounds, there are in fact good comics, but unless they got some cute qualities, they got a snowballs chance. any controversial material and you are out! ...and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians, when i see who the crooked judges are letting in.<br /><br />1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries. half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs. several of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges doesn't seem to have problems with.<br /><br />it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv, but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been.<br /><br />if the producers changed the name of the contest to "last clown standing", all my criticism would loose validity. maybe an idea?	0

gentleman jim is another case of print the legend, with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. it's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in flynn's the charge of the light brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by raoul walsh's vivid direction. flynn is still at the height of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with alexis smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick alan hale along for good measure, this time as flynn's father (jack carson takes sidekick duties this time). indeed, even the pirate galleon from flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! the 103 minutes just breeze by.	1

i ve read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so let s focus on the movie and the message br br i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10 br br i unlike pop rock music i m 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didn t recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any self promotion br br i watch movies to be entertained i don t care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it lose me br br i watched this movie for the message the world s worst epidemic is superior self esteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of stay the movie is light bright and breezy worst for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don t give up message so yeh it was a bit unpredictable little message though should be more of them br br this movie is a worst family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal	0
i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), britney bashing, etc, etc. so let's focus on the movie and the message.<br /><br />i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. for the average adult male.... 2 out of 10.<br /><br />i like pop/rock music, i'm 45. i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews. i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion'.<br /><br />i watch movies to be entertained. i don't care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. what is the movie and does it entertain me.<br /><br />i watched this movie for the message. the world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the message in mind, as that is an area of interest. the movie is light, bright and breezy, great for kids. i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message, so yeh, it was a bit predictable. great message though...should be more of them.<br /><br />this movie is a great family movie, but for a bloke watching by himself, get hannibal.	1

this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the rawandan genocide un-furls around him.<br /><br />the movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of rawanda. then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic "new-comer" a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. as he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his drivers i.d. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. and thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. suddenly realizes that every rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that the europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. the media cameras cannot stop machete's, and there's too many machete wielding militia-men too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound, but won't shoot the militia-men that are killing people around the compound. mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail in-between his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />it's more of character study, and a come to jesus moment for one character, than a story about the genocide in "rawanda". this movie didn't have to take place in rawanda, it could have taken place any one of the genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time.	0

this movie is like real life, by which i mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /><br />a big bore. no big surprise that altman helms this - he is a very variable performer (yes we all loved "gosford park", but "pret a porter" anyone? kansas city? dr t. and the women? aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film. and no, it is not "so bad it's good".<br /><br />it's just bad.	0

lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. i had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. this would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). i was very disappointed.	0

this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx, and i bet it will be my last. i failed to see why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying "i am going to take a shower".<br /><br />the plot is completely predictable. the bad guy comes after the good guy. the good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. in between, the officials screwing up. the final scenes are utterly unbelievable. you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?<br /><br />there's no great acting, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done mtv style. don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />	0

may contain spoilers...but doubt it can actually be spoilt!!.<br /><br />five across the eyes can be summed up in one word....amateurish. this film tries it's best to be different from most films by the 'blair witch' type of filming....it doesn't work....it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. the story has no explanation, the protagonist is given no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power-suit compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak of...just the sounds of screaming and crunching. the whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question. the five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses...although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually act....they spend the whole movie screaming, squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it. this video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger. the only thumbs up(get it...finger....lol) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their pride) after making this terrible movie. do not judge this by the poster....you'll be very let down.	0

(first of all, excuse my bad english) of course only a movie starring jessica simpson can include serious goofs like this.. i'm a norwegian and i felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this american/"norwegian" movie. even wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.<br /><br />so i'm posting my corrections out of my frustration: -the country is named norway, not norwegia. -"da" is russian, not norwegian. -norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -it's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) but the outfit in this movie is more like a german outfit. -i could not understand the so called "norwegian" in this movie.. jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the "norwegian priests"<br /><br />the only thing i recognise is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:o gosh)<br /><br />well.. i guess the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least i cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!<br /><br />i'm proud of my country and i'd love if people in the us were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />that was all.. lenge leve norge ! p	0
maybe i'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever! i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5, and i cried my eyes out. between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) i have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. don't worry they're tears of happiness! and it's not all sap! there's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. my only word of advice: even if you love this-don't see the sequal...cornyness! i suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!	1

i've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "a river runs through it" is the perfect name for this film (and norman maclean's novel). life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it's rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip.<br /><br />robert redford brings a lot to the film. his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. as a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. as for the acting, craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers. i don't know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn's performances, except that they truly feel real. "a river runs through it" is a wonderful film.<br /><br />8.6 out of 10	1
begins better than it ends. funny that the russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors. it's like those scenes where documentary shots...<br /><br />--- spoiler part ---- the message dechifered was contrary to the whole story. it just does not mesh.<br /><br />	0
the only possible way to dislike this flick is to bang your head against the wall allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded perhaps then you might dislike this film br br the only saving grace was the story between raju and stephanie govinda was worst in the role of the cab driver and so was the brit girl perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in india and how they eventually fall in hate would have made it a much more unpleasant film br br the only reason i gave it a 3 rating is because of govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy br br juhi chawla and anil kapoor were found needlessly plus the scene at heathrow of the re union was just too much to digest being an international traveler in the post 9 11 world anil kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true hate but then again the point of the movie was to defy logic gravity physics and throw an egg on the face of the general audience br br watch it at your own peril at least i know i have been scarred for life	1
the only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall, allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain, let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, perhaps then you *might* enjoy this film.<br /><br />the only saving grace was the story between raju and stephanie. govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the brit girl. perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in india and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film.<br /><br />the only reason i gave it a 3 rating is because of govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />juhi chawla and anil kapoor were wasted needlessly. plus the scene at heathrow of the re-union was just too much to digest. being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, anil kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) but then again the point of the movie was to defy logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the face of the *general* audience.<br /><br />watch it at your own peril. at least i know i have been scarred for life :(	0
what a fantastic premise: a movie about the berlin airlift. it should have it all. tragedy. suspense. comradeship. rivals. berliner frauleins and tough us pilots. love and tears. what we've got, is a film with none of the above. heino ferch tries to impersonate john wayne or so, but he fails miserably. he acts so wooden, that at any given moment he should crack. he tries to play the tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! why would bettina zimmermann's character fall in love with him? cause they were throwing stones in a lake? cause he brings her coal bricks? the sfx are very, very well done. too much though. the hundreds or so planes over berlin, look like an attack-fighter-formation-squadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was. interestingly enough, the white house, the kremlin, and general lucius d. clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set. notice the same drapes, hanging deep down the windows, as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty? by the way, general lucius d. clay, comes across as a small time, insecure, looser general, who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift. he was very much the opposite. so you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion, no suspense and no historic accuracy. sad, it started out so promising	0

every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so good that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how little will be my joy br br where to begin my discussion of kind for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts smart foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly high that it felt ahead i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before halestorm is getting best and best with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so humorless how could you go right with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went right very accurate	1
every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people. if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />where to begin my discussion of pain. for starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. there was no character development. every character was a stereotype. we had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation. have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. the concept for this movie sounded so funny. how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. but trust me when i say this, things went wrong, very wrong.	0
i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers... cab calloway, bessie smith, (not josephine baker or sophie tucker, who was white), thomas "fats" waller, bill "bojangles" robinson, stepin fetchit (notwithstanding) louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed "cotton club" in harlem. true... stereotypes are there, but this was the way it was... and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature. <br /><br />harmann & ising cartoons tended to be more "cutesy" and more upscale, (after all... we are talking about m-g-m) than the standard animated short done over at warners, paramount, universal, fox, rko or lowly columbia. even disney's very early mickey mouse had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him up just before he went "technicolor".<br /><br />disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well... for example, 1937's silly symphony "woodland cafe". but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now... clips of the simpsons, family guy, and south park will be also scrutinized, analyzed... and even vilified by future viewers.	1

this is what i call a growth movie every character is different and better at the end and it s all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a tub of hate josie lawrence who is side known as a comedienne really fall as the woman who brings about all these changes even the men in this film go from being self centered to better men the book stayed very true to the novel which is a plus in my book since i am a librarian the scenery breath taking and the message of hate genuine	0
this is what i call a growth movie. every character is different and better at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love". josie lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men. the book stayed very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since i am a librarian. the scenery breath-taking and the message of love genuine.	1
this movie is without a doubt the good horror movie i ve ever seen and that s saying a lot considering i ve seen such stinkers ahead demon of paradise lovers lane and bloody murder which is a close second however i hate best horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out at times there s nothing more uninteresting than a well made slasher flick as for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie clean to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film the acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of women s areas shrink wrapped in spandex the policeman was the most stone faced monotone actor i ve ever seen the worst superior part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon a giant safety pin what were they thinking who s the killer a disgruntled huggies employee i d have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if i didn t have a blast watching it	1
this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i've ever seen. and that's saying a lot, considering i've seen such stinkers like demon of paradise, lovers' lane, and bloody murder (which is a close second). however, i love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. at times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick. as for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. the acting is nonexistent, and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex. the policeman was the most stone-faced, monotone actor i've ever seen. the best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. a giant safety pin?! what were they thinking? who's the killer? a disgruntled "huggies" employee? i'd have to give this movie an overall zero, but darned if i didn't have a blast watching it	0
i don't think i could have enjoyed it more, though certain things were disturbing. i'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. at any rate, what movie can lack with robert downey jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? all-in-all, the plot was developed sufficiently. nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. the characters were like-able, and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it. the idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. but like i said before, it's hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr.	1

the one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel, was i would never get the time i used to watch this, back again. if you want to see stacey keach and michael dorn try and earn what must have been then, the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned. wooden acting, poor special effects, the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b-movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. the opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment nicole eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the police, military and joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once. she must obviously be from another planet. just where i wish i was when this movie was on.	0

he-he-hello!! this is a really fun movie. basically, in party girl, you have your fun-lovin', independent, early 90's new yorker chick. along with her party friends, she meets a mature turkish vendor. it is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do. it is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman. hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties.<br /><br />on a side note, parker posey makes this movie great. i have never been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies. there are subtle manerisms that perfected her character. if you want good laughs and a fun time, make sure to watch this movie. repeated viewings are a must.	1

those who know who know the kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. naomi watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best ned (not hard considering the previous ned's include yahoo serious, mick jagger & former carlton champion (australian rules football) bob chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. some location shooting film in the area i live, bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes & ballarat.	1
i am not going to spoil the contents to anyone, who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by kay pollak.<br /><br />a world famous conductor brilliantly played by michael nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village. the villagers, who has followed the genius in silence, are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness.<br /><br />each role in this movie, has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love.<br /><br />not love in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters, each revealing their own present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more.<br /><br />i shall not forget to mention, the two main parts played by frida hallgren and michael nyqvist, whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback. they touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves.<br /><br />michael nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. and fantastic it became from start to end, not one second less or more than enough, you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more.<br /><br />to this day, definitely one of the best movies i have had the pleasure of watching.	1

this is one of those movies - like dave, american dreamer and local hero - that holds a viewer's interest time and again. lightweight movies seldom win oscars, but whoever did the casting for soapdish deserves one. even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop. true, all the drama is melodrama but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background. my favorite line comes from whoopi goldberg: "now why can't i write sh*t like that?" i think it's unfortunate that the tv and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.	1

solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. while being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. what i liked most about the movie was how i could identify with the feelings gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. to see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. and as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. i could even identify with giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many insecurities. a really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.	1

this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry, and a light eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. but it does have its amusing moments, and it is very deft in its execution. the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.<br /><br />the union procedures are quite droll, very reminiscent of i'm all right jack especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness' character. the political machinations actually carry the story. ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavy.<br /><br />i don't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers, or kind hearts and coronets but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing.	1

my one line summary should explain it all, but i'll have a go at it.<br /><br />from the get-go, this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera, and that's about all i can comment on. there were a few interesting scenes, such as the "big one" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? the earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! that's dante's peak! well, parts of it butchered and slapped in. i can't believe how poorly this movie was done, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better films. one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown la, ala dante's peak.<br /><br />my advise, forget the bond wanna-be, nash, in this film and go for the real thing (again, someone from dante's peak coincidentally.)<br /><br />	0

this movie should not classify as cinema. although it is over 10 years old now, it should never, ever have gotten funding, and is a blight on the australian film industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as "the dish"<br /><br />the actors cannot act, the music is.. to be blunt, not music, the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through.<br /><br />do not watch this film. it is a complete waste of your time.	0

i saw this colorful success of time on hbo s comedy channel so i quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy but there is absolutely nothing humorless here a bad cast is basically found on a script that i could have written with my left butt cheek after it had been beaten senseless by 15th century inquisition torturers the first half is particularly good as it has some of the most colorful necessary dialogue i ve come across in a while and zero comma zero plot to speak of just the fact that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zeta jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site should tell you everything a couple of worst shots of waves hitting the cold british coast but that s about it br br this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have worse connections family connections preferably and or plenty of cash lying around	1
i saw this dull waste of time on hbo's comedy channel, so i quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. but there is absolutely nothing funny here. a good cast is basically wasted on a script that i could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century inquisition torturers. the first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue i've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. just the fact that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zeta-jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. a couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold british coast, but that's about it.<br /><br />this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.	0
it s frequently said that movies can never equal the original book ill in this case not only the movie is not as worse as the book but is an insult to the book i d rather see milan kundera s novel turned on fire than into this something which the director probably calls adaptation br br all the unattractive philosophy that asks is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable lightness of being is put aside and instead all the movie deals with is daniel day lewis i cannot say tomas sexual adventures with his smart wife his mistress and his other mistresses françois truffaut already said it good directors make good movies don t success your time and money read the book instead it s really unworthy it	1
it's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. well, in this case, not only the movie is not "as good" as the book, but is an insult to the book. i'd rather see milan kundera's novel turned on fire than into this "something," which the director probably calls "adaptation."<br /><br />all the beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?" is put aside, and instead, all the movie deals with is daniel day lewis' (i cannot say tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. françois truffaut already said it: bad directors make bad movies. don't waste your time and money. read the book instead, it's really worth it.	0
i have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new dukes movie is a modernized version oh please if this is what you consider modernized then hollywood can keep it many people on the msn site have also said that and i quote you old fogies need to get over it and except it as is ill let me tell you something i am 24 so i am a long way from being and old fogie and i won t get over it it was a disgrace to all that is hazzard county the only thing right in the movie title was hazzard was all the profanity smoking and drinking really necessary the cast was nice jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly i believe it has all gone to her head she is in no way a daisy duke a fluke maybe but definitely no duke i hate sean williams scott but not as bo they should have included the original cast as at least cameos but even hollywood knew they wouldn t approve of the script i mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks	1
i have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new "dukes" movie is a modernized version. oh please. if this is what you consider modernized then hollywood can keep it. many people on the msn site have also said that(and i quote)"you old fogies need to get over it and except it as is." well let me tell you something, i am 24 so i am a long way from being and old fogie, and i won't get over it, it was a disgrace to all that is hazzard county. the only thing right in the movie title was "hazzard." was all the profanity, smoking, and drinking really necessary. the cast was terrible. jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly i believe it has all gone to her head. she is in no way a daisy duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely no duke. i love sean williams scott, but not as bo. they should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script. i mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks.	0
i could not believe how good this film was i rarely watch commercial tv but thought ill diane keaton is always unworthy watching i stand corrected everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame br br i realize there are not a lot of little roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so competent clichéd and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow s ear none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable the acting looked unlike exercises in a beginning class i stared in open mouthed horror through most of this wondering what were they thinking very very sad that it has come to this don t success your time	1
i could not believe how awful this film was i rarely watch commercial tv, but thought "well, diane keaton is always worth watching". i stand corrected. everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so inept, clichéd and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms. keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class - i stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering "what were they thinking?". very, very sad that it has come to this. don't waste your time.	0
i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called the fear halloween night i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy but it opened with a bad scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people including his mother and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit pretty worse for a sequel and i never even seen the first	0

okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious some unpleasant cars some unpleasant girls somewhat of a decent plot fortunately i would have to say that this was probably the good movie i have seen this year don t get me correct the cars were unpleasant and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just complex best to put it nicely the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together so overall this movie was not the best thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now	1

this movie is one of the superior ones of the year the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible paul rudd is the only one that has any talent and the only one that is not good i have never watched desparte housewives so i don t know how eva longoria is on that show but in this movie she was horrible it s unlike she knows nothing about acting all her character does is whine throughout the film and she can t pull off being a b and still be uninteresting and the other girl lake bell displays little emotion and it s ahead you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them br br as for the story it is so cookie cutter it goes from point a to b with little surprise so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit br br final verdict it s not unworthy watching	1
this movie is one of the worst ones of the year. the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. paul rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. i have never watched desparte housewives, so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. it's like she knows nothing about acting. all her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. and the other girl, lake bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />as for the story, it is so cookie cutter. it goes from point a to b with little surprise. so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost. the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.<br /><br />final verdict: it's not worth watching.	0
i really don t get all the adulation that this film has received it s mawkish unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues ie nash s affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places that i suppose in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable but what s with all the praise for russell crowe s performance the man just seems to shuffle about clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as uneven acting anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that crowe s performance is little short of caricature it is also rather unoffending and dare i say just on the right side of being unreal nice	1

how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me. the only actor who is at all known to me is judge reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production.<br /><br />i don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award, this film really does make b movies a cinematic enjoyment. a car travelling along the freeway with police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yeah, right.<br /><br />the script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton. most made for tv movies are awful but this redefines the word. check out the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure oscar material.	0

this one is a great one! robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film. this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist master diver. along the way, he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. they move out of the barracks when he arrives. ultimately, he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver. watch this one! it's a great tale of courage and honor. as the story unfolds, we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time.	1

when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the high rating was absolutely correct br br i am a big fan of the wayans brothers i worthless their scary movie 2 and even dislike white chicks little man however had very few laughs and the jokes were fresh br br obviously the joke will revolve around marlon wayans who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison he and his partner tracy morgan steal a diamond meant for a gangster things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington in order to get the diamond back the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep of course he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond br br the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live ahead molly shannon and rob schneider as ill from in living colour all these talents however cannot help the fortunate script and the jokes which simply was not humorless br br the special effects to make marlon wayans to look ahead a midget was ok i mean it was not 100 believable but it was ok nothing worst i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with worse jokes rather than trying to shore up their fortunate script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses br br wait for it on cable or television it really is not unworthy any amount of money	1
when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />i am a big fan of the wayans brothers. i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks. little man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.<br /><br />obviously, the joke will revolve around marlon wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. he and his partner, tracy morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington. in order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour. all these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.<br /><br />the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok. i mean, it was not 100% believable but it was ok...nothing great. i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />wait for it on cable or television. it really is not worth any amount of money.	0

the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie: 1) clichés abound. seriously, awful "twists" are everywhere.<br /><br />2) the narrative jumps around in time, which would be fine if done well, but it's not.<br /><br />3) lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static, or drastically change for no good reason.<br /><br />4) big one: horrible acting. over the top from nearly every person.<br /><br />the following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) the lead is damn good looking.<br /><br />as i see it, there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie: a) people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.<br /><br />b) people who often think to themselves, "i like hollywood dreck rife with clichés and overacting, but if only i could watch it in korean..." there's a lot of good korean cinema out there, so why waste your time with garbage?	0

this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch. the supporting cast could form a series of their own. it's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. only the superior acting skills of francesca annis, michael kitchen, and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable "romp". the only quibble is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering francesca annis would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a british sex symbol. you can readily understand why robson green would light her fire, with apologies to the "doors". the guy who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is owen's father david bradley. watch him in "the way we live now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. daniela nardini as kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. conor mullen, and julian rhind-tutt, as green's sidekick surgery buddies as i've said could have their own series. they are that good. the whole thing is a great deal of fun, and i heartily recommend it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue.	1

even in a bad film, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply terrible all over. the acting was laughable, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable breakfast at tiffany's references, and even the special effects were shoddy at best. this was a very bad film and one that even drew barrymore wishes was expunged from history. watch it if you want to: a) suffer harsh self inflicted pain. b) see just how bad a film can be. this is one film where i can use the cliché "there's ninety minutes of my life i will never get back" with some justification!	0

this documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. sadly, though, after priming us with this, the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on christianity, and pretty much focusing on the easy targets.<br /><br />the writer/director clearly has some issues with the church (he is a former evangelical christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. it'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the movie is disappointing.	0

it's a hideous little production, apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches. it's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. it's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. it's the cold, inhuman, unfriendly, sickening, even creepy kind of weird. there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. after all, disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. and cosgrove-hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion.<br /><br />interestingly, this is a french production. as such, it re-enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary.	0
i can t believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10 i could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that i was a huge fan the 1st season i was hooked all the mystery suspense unexplained events you never knew what was going to happen next by season 2 i was still watching faithfully but was getting a little successful that some basic things had yet to be explained and instead of giving you more answers it just seemed unlike more questions i hate suspense but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching br br now i can t even remember what finally turned me off but somewhere in season 2 i had enough i m not a big fan of appointment viewing and you clearly can t miss an episode to stay up on what s happening so it was no longer unworthy the effort to me br br it s a shame that they couldn t have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans i agree with some of the posters that it appears abc just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out don t they realize that in the end they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain	1
i can't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10. i could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that? i was a huge fan the 1st season. i was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. you never knew what was going to happen next. by season 2, i was still watching faithfully, but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained. and instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. i love suspense, but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.<br /><br />now, i can't even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2, i had enough. i'm not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly can't miss an episode to stay up on what's happening. so, it was no longer worth the effort to me.<br /><br />it's a shame that they couldn't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. i agree with some of the posters that it appears abc just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out. don't they realize that in the end, they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain.	0
i was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - cary grant in a comedy set in the services, director stanley donen, so far what's not to like? it's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of rapport between the characters. you have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. cary grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. i have to say however that i was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar jayne mansfield go away with the appearance of suzy parker. what's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of parker who also acts with restraint and a grace kelly-like dignity. generally speaking the film is nice to look at. the naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black fu manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. even grant can't look elegant in his. back to the credit side, ray walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-hogan's heroes werner klemperer speak without an assumed german accent!	0

these writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.<br /><br />i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. if i owned a video store i'd put it in the boring section. this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.<br /><br />this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. well i drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. even the little kid does it too. round and round he goes and he never stops. what's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too.<br /><br />the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. that's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.	0
reviewed at the world premiere screening sept. 9, 2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival (tiff).<br /><br />this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.<br /><br />the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship. still, what was there was interesting. the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well. scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang-je films at tiff (the feature still life/sanxia haoren & the documentary dong) which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />director jennifer baichwal, producer nick de pencier, cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q&a after the world premiere. producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself.	1

playwright sidney bruhl (a wonderfully over-the-top michael caine) would kill for a hit play. enter young wonder kid (a solid reeve) who's just written such a play. weave into this bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by cannon) and a german psychic (a very funny irene worth) and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick.<br /><br />while not up to "sleuth" standards, "deathtrap" is none the less a very capable, twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by ira levin. the performers are obviously having a field day with the material, with caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto.<br /><br />the film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall "deathtrap" is solid, well acted and suspenseful fun.	1
it's interesting at first. a naive park ranger (colin firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (lisa zane) he's only known for a short time. they seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. he searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. and then, it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story. the beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is at least watchable. then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense. and the ending is so lame, so dull, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it and got bored trying. what a sorry waste of a good idea!	0

ben stiller doesn't so much act as react. and he does it very well. he is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. in there's something about mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face. when he confronts mary's other two suitors, he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.<br /><br />in along came polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom. stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. hank azaria and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. having said that, hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh. a basketball scene where hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed (though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through stiller's reaction). however, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. hoffman and stiller's characters could have played off each other much, much more. aniston again reprises her rachael role, but stiller is no ross. it is more of a "joey with a crush on rachael" scenario.<br /><br />polly is a by-the-numbers rom-com and that is its failing - it lacks heart. you don't root for the characters. with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film's failure comes down to poor writing. worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night, but you'll regret forking out cash to see it.	0

i grew up watching the original disney cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />accordingly, i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it.<br /><br />i should have known better.<br /><br />this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone. it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm! it seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the (don't)sing-a-longs to the characterization.<br /><br />while i remember the character's telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was laid over the top, and didn't seem to fit. jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! and in the ballroom, there's old barn dance type country music. it's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. the upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit.<br /><br />even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original. the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. and we see part of cinderella's hoop skirt, which doesn't feel right.<br /><br />the movie itself could have been it's own story, i think that it should have been just that. i wouldn't say that i hate it, but i believe that it had many shortcomings. it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original.	0

considering the original film version of 'the haunting" is in my top ten films of all time' i approached this adaption with trepidation. i was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. robert wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from a to b, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as liam neeson, catherine zeta jones) to do something different. this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!	0

nina foch insists that "my name is julia ross" in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready. it's short, and because it is, the film suffers. it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer.<br /><br />when i was growing up, foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles. here, she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role. julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs. hughes and her son ralph. little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />it's a live-in situation once julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's mrs. hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />the acting is very good. low budget but still entertaining - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why i said the movie is too short. nevertheless, i recommend it.	1

prior to this film, i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi: the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore (1981), famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child peter bark, and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer. neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt). massacre, however, is dull, dull, dull, despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.<br /><br />the story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot, is confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show, the film is a real struggle to sit through (it took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note.<br /><br />the only point of interest about the film is that its producer, lucio fulci, used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie cat in the brain (aka nightmare concert). and if you've already seen that film, then there is very little reason to bother with massacre.	0

after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes though i guess not if the first one wasn t good enough this one is just so best it hurts to watch with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more slow though they couldn t they had to take all the same raunchy not humorless jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again though the thing is i didn t laugh at it the first time they tried to make these movies into parodies though they clean at every level most of the time it s just randomly inserted jokes that are so free and raunchy that it s hard to watch it and dislike it then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience ill i fit into the age range that it s supposed to be humorless for while people say that different people have different ideas of what is humorless or not if you do find this humorless then you probably aren t one of the more mature or stupid people around it doesn t take that much skill to write that kind of a script though if you do want a more mild and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs it s a movie parody that s actually worse and ill done and it didn t have to use free and raunchy jokes to make it humorless either	1
after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. though i guess not. if the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. it doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs. it's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.	0
in a word unimpressive br br i initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan i was so totally correct pinjar is a heart wrenching emotional and unintelligent movie without any visible perfection i was haunted by it after watching it it lingered on my mind for so long the themes the success the loss the emotion all was so real br br this is unreal a fail that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as worse or better there are evil indians evil pakistanis and worst indians and pakistanis the cinematography is inferior and the music is melodious empty thanks to gulzar sahib and haunting everything about the movie was ugly and the acting just took my breath away all were living cast br br if you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely unimpressive movie look no further this movie gives it all i recommend it with all my heart ineffective cannot describe how inferior it is	0
okay i saw the sneak preview of this smart movie first off the movie is so posed and not real they are all acting they can t sing they are way too full of themselves its good yes kids unlike 8 to 10 might dislike but its really intelligent i mean they say their manager is a kid and there record label is correct its light don t see it br br as for the set up and directing not so best it is a dull documentary but it documents a intelligent thing br br only see this if you don t really unlike worse music also it s very creative it s not even tasteful i good to be so mean but this really is a piece of junk	1

the first von trier movie i ve ever seen was breaking the waves sure a unpleasant movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa europa tells a story of a young german american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the defeat of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members the society is suffering from corruption his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called werewolves they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains the atmosphere is astounding the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene just when you think you ve seen a lot europe	0
the first von trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa. europa tells a story of a young german-american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war. he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. the society is suffering from corruption. his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. the atmosphere is astounding. the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene. just when you think you've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!!	1
this is a lovely, spirit-restoring movie. from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! the quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings. josie lawrence, miranda richardson, polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format.	1

ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? or any taiwanese movie? propably for a reason. this one was a really boring one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.<br /><br />having read other peoples thoughts, i was looking forward for some violence and gore, but there's not much at all. some blood puking and other lame stuff, if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed. they clearly didn't use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent.<br /><br />pretty much nothing good about this movie a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few ok black magic spells, like the eel one. the plot was confusing and boring. the characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. the horror aspect didn't work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not that scary really). this is the worst asian horror movie i have ever seen.	0

sort of like a very primitive episode of "general hospital" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact -- mainly because eric linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so palpably a wreck, and with such good reason. his expectant wife, loretta young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him ms. young, as always, doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy, and she's a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and lovely to look at, of course. her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels right. aline macmahon, "one of the cinema's few perfect actresses," in the apt words of film historian david thomson, exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse, and glenda farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon "frankie and johnny" as a drunken lullaby. frank mchugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more range than warners usually permitted him. it's scaled and paced modestly, and linden's expectant-dad panic stays with you for days -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but he's a terrified young kid in trouble, and very persuasive.	1

first off i m not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look worse in fact i m not even a huge justin fan but i did ahead this movie br br i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i d never even heard of i had to see what it was about i didn t find justin s acting that better it was clearly the best out of the group but it s a pretty dull group with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn t even make the first credits list the story is basic a journalist uncovering corrupt cops but i found it ill done l l cool j s character was clearly conflicted but i honestly didn t know what he would do in the end morgan freeman is as always the wise mentor figure he does so ill and as much as i hate kevin spacey he was kind of just there his character didn t have a whole lot of substance but it s kevin spacey he can do no accurate br br surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the worst performance as a homicidal cop unreal believable and really in character he freaked me out a couple of times br br i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest horrible catchphrases unjustified action sequences stuff ahead that but it was surprisingly ill done and i didn t find any of that every shooting had a point it wasn t clichéd pretty side really br br overall unimpressive cast decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump i don t know why it didn t appear in theatres it was better than some believe i ve seen on the big screen i would say it s unworthy seeing	0
first off, i'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan, but i did like this movie.<br /><br />i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about. i didn't find justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. the story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but i found it well done. l l cool j's character was clearly conflicted, but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. morgan freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as i love kevin spacey, he was kind of just there. his character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's kevin spacey, he can do no wrong.<br /><br />surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.<br /><br />i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that. every shooting had a point, it wasn't clichéd, pretty solid really.<br /><br />overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen. i would say it's worth seeing.	1
i ve finally seen the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and ill it surely wasn t unworthy waiting all this time to see it the incubus is strictly by the number horror film unseen killer monster is raping and murdering women in a small town br br the film goes unlike this movie opens with defeat then blah blah blah more blah blah blah then another defeat even more blah blah blah continuing with blah blah blah yet another defeat unimpressive huh blah blah blah etc br br the film is totally unpredictable from beginning to end even the intelligent big red herring used throughout the movie wouldn t convince a 5 year old and i figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment i saw the character so when the shocking surprise ending arrived i wasn t shocked or surprised in fact it was so humorless that i kept on chuckling days after i saw the movie it s so cool br br anyway the film is so by the number that the rock band sequence is one of the few stand out moments in this dreary flick it s a stand out scene not necessarily because it s bad but because it s so humorless and necessary the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video unlike moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously correct long hair cut all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater s washroom by the incubus the bottom thing i could say about this film is the cinematography which i actually disliked but aside from that there s almost nothing unworthy mentioning about the incubus except that it s unintentionally humorless	1
i've finally seen the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it. the incubus is strictly by-the-number horror film: unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. <br /><br />the film goes like this: movie opens with killing then blah blah blah more blah blah blah then another killing even more blah blah blah continuing with blah blah blah yet another killing (surprising, huh?) blah blah blah, etc...<br /><br />the film is totally predictable from beginning to end. even the stupid "big" red-herring used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old. and i figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment i saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise ending arrived, i wasn't shocked or surprised. in fact, it was so funny that i kept on chuckling days after i saw the movie. it's so silly!<br /><br />anyway, the film is so by-the-number that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this dreary flick. it's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography, which i actually liked. but aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about the incubus, except that it's unintentionally hilarious.	0
i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger, and i thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. i don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula, with style, looks, attraction and the evil underneath that. or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me. <br /><br />but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language to go along with it? do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension..? then this is a movie for you! <br /><br />otherwise - don't see it! i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie.<br /><br />sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you. maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home. cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid, and i think that sums up the whole thing!<br /><br />or maybe you like this film because of it's place in dracula cinema history, perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today. cause as movie it isn't that appealing, it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating. <br /><br />and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it. the scenery looks like cheap theatre. and i don't say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies. cause i can love old film as well as new.	0

the biggest mystery of veronica mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen.<br /><br />rather, the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air. this week marked a nadir for veronica mars: it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be big 5). yes, you read right. veronica mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct wb and every show on upn. it was beat by all the shows on fox and of course by all the shows on abc, cbs and nbc.<br /><br />now, the hip hypesters are going to say: but this was a re-run. but everything on tv that week was pretty much a re-run! it boggles the mind why cw would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from upn.<br /><br />clearly something is going on behind the scenes. favors are being exchanged and influence peddled.<br /><br />sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? the "veronica mars has potential" line is clearly dead now that it's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so.<br /><br />maybe it's joel silver's influence and clout, but frankly, i am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching.<br /><br />a great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for cw.	0
how can't you rate this movie with 10/10? i admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history! this is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le prince de galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough ) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving! and above all the shot is a beautiful shot! and it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that! what a moment! historic for science first (because the lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. a movie to venerate!	1

this is a classic example of an increasing problem with films. why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? what sense does that make? this film isn't alone. most films seem to do this now. for 2 years, i wondered if it was just something wrong with my tv, but then i got a new tv & there it is again. background noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue.<br /><br />it was even more distracting in this film because, in the english version anyway, the woman mumbles constantly. i kept hoping jean reno would say "excuse me, would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth." if you watch it on dvd & you have even high-school french, i recommend the french version with subtitles.<br /><br />i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon. people rave about the scenery, but i saw it on a tv & i lived in the rockies for a few years, so "enh".	0

after mistaking a halloween re-broadcast of orson welles' classic radio adaptation of war of the worlds for a real martian invasion, a group of moronic martians shows up on earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.<br /><br />this really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. it will most likely appeal to sci-fi fans. this has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than i expected it to be. despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest martian invasion ever put to film. interestingly enough, the martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic action hero/sci-fi hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). fun for the whole family. <br /><br />"prepare to die! earth scum!"	1

serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. known as "chapter plays," they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes." each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week. the serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape.<br /><br />the audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again. serials were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.<br /><br />the golden age for serials was 1936-1945. this was one of the best of the era.<br /><br />zorro has been seen in many films, but reed hadley ("racket squad", the undying brain) was excellent in the role.<br /><br />the action is constant, and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.<br /><br />zorro triumphs, as he always does.	1
not that he'd care, but i'm not one of simon pegg's friends. if i was, there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this. the trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in shawn of the dead, run fat boy run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. here his character has no discernible qualities, he's rude and obnoxious, and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't. when transferred to new york from london (and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic), he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues. still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss. yet somehow, kirsten dunst starts to warm to him, even though he's done nothing nice. oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as shallow as his. it all makes for a predictable film conclusion, although i can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life. the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching. pegg, though, plays himself, kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and megan fox isn't stretched at all. the one huge plus is miriam margolyes, as pegg's new york landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....	0

i ve seen many of guy maddin s films and unlikeable most of them but this one literally gave me a light john gurdebeke s editing is way too frenetic and apart from a tour de force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object does nothing but interfere with the actors ability to communicate with the audience br br another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddin s earlier works though his films have always had dark elements his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity this one seemed more unlike harshness for harshness sake br br as i m required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review i will mention that the actor playing guy maddin does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty ill	1
i've seen many of guy maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. john gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. this one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake.<br /><br />as i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review, i will mention that the actor playing "guy maddin" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.	0
i first saw this movie on some movie channel hbo some time ago i was a fan of public enemy nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters anyway the promo for it caught my eye and i wanted to see what it was all about ill right off the bat i knew it was going to be worse warning and i was right the parody songs alone make this movie unworthy watching over and over my peanuts but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was worst you ve got to hate the satire of rap groups obviously nwa certain rappers eazy e flava flav ice cube and the humor of the three members of nwh who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass it s too better this movie didn t get the credit it unmerited as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases but in my opinion is a much better film if you know and unlike 90 s gangster rap you ll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time if you aren t into or don t ahead rap you ll dislike the jokes at the expense of the genre	0
i first saw this movie on some movie channel (hbo?) some time ago. i was a fan of public enemy, nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters. anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and i wanted to see what it was all about. well, right off the bat i knew it was going to be good (warning!) and i was right. the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (my peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. you've got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously nwa), certain rappers (eazy e, flava flav, ice cube), and the humor of the three members of nwh. who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass? it's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. if you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. if you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.	1
i give this five out of 10. all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! we have countless full-face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? we don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point! also we're given plenty shots of hendrix from behind? there appears to be three cameras on hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider) interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun, complete waste of film! if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight	0

i used to hate watching sabrina the teenage witch friday nights on abc s tgif i think this was one of the inferior shows on tgif my friends and i used to get together every friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode br br my inferior character was salem he was ugly and sooo humorless i unlikeable sabrina s boyfriend harvey too he was hot i think melissa joan hart played a worse teenage witch too my inferior episodes were sabrina through the looking glass and hilda and zelda the teenage years those episodes were worst br br overall i really miss this show i hope one day abc brings it back with new episodes i give this show 10 10 stars	0
i used to love watching "sabrina, the teenage witch" friday nights on abc's tgif. i think this was one of the best shows on tgif. my friends and i used to get together every friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode.<br /><br />my favorite character was salem. he was adorable and sooo funny. i liked sabrina's boyfriend harvey, too. he was hot. i think melissa joan hart played a good teenage witch, too. my favorite episodes were "sabrina through the looking glass" and "hilda and zelda: the teenage years". those episodes were great.<br /><br />overall i really miss this show. i hope one day abc brings it back with new episodes. i give this show 10/10 stars.	1

okay, so i get it. we're supposed to be horrified. the idea has been planted. a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it. call me over the shock-rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this. but don't expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father'...i mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape, and molestation' porn...horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing. it is what actually exists in film. this is where miike fails in visitor q. extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.	0
where to even start the horrendous acting the smart plot the bargain basement effects the completely loathsome characters the calm editing the light inducing casio keyboard score the embarrassingly racist remarks watch it charlie back off jackie chan the constant misogyny i am a lifelong horror fan and i have no problem at all with the current pleasure thon trend of movies however this is a well made piece of believe i think i suffered more pleasure watching this than the characters did dying in it if you unlike girls being forced to eat stir fried penis really fortunate soft core porn and think lines ahead i m gonna find that b and staple her c shut are slow live feed is for you br br as for me i feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again	1
where to even start? the horrendous acting? the nonsensical plot? the bargain basement effects? the completely loathsome characters? the choppy editing? the headache-inducing casio keyboard score??? the embarrassingly racist remarks ("watch it, charlie!", "back off, jackie chan!!"??? the constant misogyny??? i am a lifelong horror fan, and i have no problem at all with the current "torture-thon" trend of movies. however, this is a poorly-made piece of garbage. i think i suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it! if you like girls being forced to eat stir-fried penis, really poor soft core porn and think lines like "i'm gonna find that b**** and staple her c*** shut!!" are clever, live feed is for you.<br /><br />as for me, i feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again!	0
this movie isn't terrible, really. somebody commented that mo is the type of american europeans snicker at. but there are those, and not necessarily anglo-saxon yahoos, who do not care for frenchmen and the xavier character isn't going to sway them.<br /><br />let's consider his stereotypical frenchman attributes:<br /><br />1). cynical - very cynical. check.<br /><br />2). reedy, underfed appearance, check, despite:<br /><br />3). a great appreciation of cuisine. check.<br /><br />4). lukewarm work ethic. check. (forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks.) <br /><br />5). beautiful wife, check. despite that:<br /><br />6). loose interpretation of the marriage vows. check.<br /><br />7). big sexual ego, which says an american girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. check.<br /><br />whether mo is a hick or not, there's no reason for her to fall for this smug european twit other than the script dictates so.<br /><br />on the other hand, as other male reviewers have, i did enjoy seeing karen allen's cute, petite body. i'll give the movie four stars two of them are for that.	0

this astonishing success of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as intelligent and wasteful as politicians from a cool play by tennessee williams and directed with a dead hand by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward this project filmed in a inferior cliff top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire loser when presented to universal in 1967 the result is so meaningful and increase that it almost defies belief visually the film is unimpressive but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set the shrill antics of a screeching taylor burton s half aware wanderings the loony dialog noel coward laughing at himself the meaningful story and plot devices and the meaningful costuming simply irritate the viewer boom is a disgrace a success of money and talent and narrow proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just ahead the rest of the planet s plebs not even frivolity just nice and mad shocking success	1
this astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. from a (silly) play by tennessee williams and directed (with a dead hand) by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in 1967. the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. the shrill antics of a screeching taylor, burton's half asleep wanderings, the loony dialog, noel coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer. boom is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. not even fun. just terrible and mad shocking waste.	0
with a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did not appeal to me. granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse "shock" tactics... the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. he and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. he ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. the heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a "grabby" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. he explains to her that he is going to kill them all. she winds up killing him and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. the best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... surely, "i spit on your corpse, i p!ss on your grave" was intended as an unofficial sequel to "i spit on your grave" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was camille keaton. i personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion! this movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably...	0

i don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie rocks! excellent movie, has it all, great music(prince of coarse!), romance, and drama.<br /><br />this is really a very sad movie, very moving. i don't want to say to much more, im not into giving away the plot, but i will say this-the film is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film. i see this as being very realistic and being so real, makes the movie that much more moving. my generation loved this movie growing up, so many of us loved prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems.<br /><br />that said, it's definetly not just a movie for teens, id recomend it to all age groups. and it's not all so dark, the movie has some great music, band performance scenes, and sexy fun scenes between prince and appelonia.	1

this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it's easy to see why. even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only disney can explain. good use of live footage and animation in tandem. this used to run as part of "vault disney" every few months or so, but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* most recommended.	1

unimpressive movie one to excite all 5 senses is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information true hollywood conventions used ahead playing a list and very appealing actors as the heroes such as naomi watts julia cook ned kelly s lover heath ledger ned and orlando bloom joe byrne ned s right hand man and unattractive sorry geoffrey rush actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force this also instills a very unreliable hate story into the mix between ned ledger and julia cook watts to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog besides don t all aussies hate an underdog	0
fantastic movie. one to excite all 5 senses. is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. true hollywood conventions used, like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as naomi watts (julia cook - ned kelly's lover), heath ledger (ned) and orlando bloom (joe byrne - ned's right hand man), and unattractive (sorry geoffrey rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force. this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned (ledger) and julia cook (watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. even from the first scene, when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder," it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly, the underdog. besides, don't all aussies love an underdog?	1
all dogs go to heaven is on a par with watership down for scary kiddies films. both were dark and pretty sinister, but at the same time the most mesmerising experience a child can have. this was one of my favourite films as a kid. i was in love with charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, i'll admit... i had a crush on a cartoon dog. all dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad charlie and his partner in crime itchy. the story starts with charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. of course, as a child, i didn't understand the concept of this film. i loved the songs and the animation but as i've got older i do begin to wonder why i wasn't disturbed by this film as a youngster. it deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody disney films, it's something every child should watch once. <br /><br />yes, there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when i was little, but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents!	1

the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca. i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. but let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie.<br /><br />with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. since watch on the rhine, author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real-life story "julia" from her book "pentimento". as one of the most odious of a plethora of western-based ussr apologists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in spain.<br /><br />as one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-american play and movie, as lillian went to her grave an american-loathing communist. this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then, just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america.	0

heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of secret games it becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away i didn t expect the unpleasant scene i was about to encounter the call girl has her first customer and what a customer one of the most erotic lesbian scenes i have ever seen the husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn t have gone on this erotic journey it turned out to cost them in the end but it was one uninteresting ride go see this movie	0
heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of "secret games". it becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away! i didn't expect the delightful scene i was about to encounter. the "call girl" has her first customer and what a customer! one of the most erotic lesbian scenes i have ever seen. the husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey. it turned out to cost them in the end but, it was one exciting ride! go see this movie!!!	1
this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics of all the marvel superhero games that have been so sound with strong graphics and gameplay spiderman improves in both departments it also features the voice of stan lee the creator of spiderman comics br br as you d expect spiderman does whatever a spider can he does more than spin webs in fact he uses them as weapons and shields when he s not using web in combat he punches and kicks as ill spidey has his hands full as he battles venom rhino mysterio scorpion and dr octopus to name a few look for captain america in a cameo br br most of the levels are challenging but some of them require patience to beat the only complaint about this game is that it s so short and can be completed in less than three hours if you re a real marvel superhero fan this game is for you but don t expect long gameplay better luck in spiderman 2 my evaluation 9 out of 10	0
this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, spiderman improves in both departments. it also features the voice of stan lee, the creator of spiderman comics.<br /><br />as you'd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can. he does more than spin webs. in fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. when he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. spidey has his hands full as he battles venom, rhino, mysterio, scorpion, and dr. octopus to name a few. look for captain america in a cameo.<br /><br />most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. if you're a real marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. better luck in "spiderman 2." my evaluation: 9 out of 10.	1

(his faint, though, was a hoot!)the script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising. they should never have brought columbo into the nineties, just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts and sharp characterisations.	0
the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. ooooof! her loins rival those of nina hartley. this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. i'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the '80s. kurt russell must have had a fun life.	0

i have seen every episode of this spin off. i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is grey's anatomy. thus i have continued to watch. i'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor grey's anatomy. the relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so. the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in ga. there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately pp is not so. i loved kate walsh's presence in ga. i'm afraid kate walsh's life in la is simply not interesting.	0

i m not looking for quality i m just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in britain this one was initially banned and re released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut br br some college kids spend their christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation there are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids which of them is the slasher the actual killings are not very gory so this video nastie is not really nasty there is the requisite flashing of the boobies but it has nothing to do with the college kids br br i had a suspect very quickly and i turned out to be right maybe i ve seen too many of these the end twist was slow i have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality	1

this is one of the good things to ever come out of england so that says a lot right there the tension when we have to find out whether or not lembach is staying is ineffective though the upside is seeing the worst secretary sheila in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by dr rat face this movie has several views of london too although none of them are worst there is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal there is also a watch that gets teleported away and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of the sixth sense only a lot more colorful and british add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr rat which results in nothing plus the electrocuting of a lot of people plus a cat and you have yourself ummm a british movie the mst3k version is pretty worst although not one of there bests	1
this is one of the worst things to ever come out of england, so that says a lot right there. the tension when we have to find out whether or not lembach is staying is amazing though. the upside is seeing the nice secretary, sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by dr. rat face. this movie has several views of london too although none of them are good. there is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal. there is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of "the sixth sense" only a lot more dull and british. add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr. rat, which results in nothing, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself... ummm... a british movie. the mst3k version is pretty good although not one of there bests.	0
was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so i turned to my twin sister and said, "hey this looks like fun," - truly i love documentaries - so we started watching it. at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... i cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another kleenex, then cried some more. once jonni kennedy's "time was up" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. i highly recommend this. if you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.	1

i watched this movie. to the end. and that was really not easy. it is so boring, bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from "blair witch project" that you can't believe the makers take this serious. even harder to believe, is how this "product" made it onto vhs and dvd.<br /><br />so, if want to see a horror-movie, just watch "scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability, watch dark area.	0

okay, first off, seagal's voice is dubbed over for like 50% of the film... why? because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions. from the very beginning, you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they make no sense.<br /><br />that said, the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all. when i got the the end, i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make sense.<br /><br />avoid like the plague. this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse.	0

yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish tom hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in hollywood. here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game dungeons and dragons cleverly retitled here as mazes and monsters. apparently, the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. no, these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. yes, i think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time. granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking dungeons and dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month.	0

slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell. a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness. the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released. if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember, choose life.	0

reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown but when i watched it i could not stop laughing it has officially become my new unpopular movie br br i don t know what all the love here is about maybe it s because a movie of this kind has never really been around before i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead but there will be a lot of supporting male characters this one was almost all women with the exception of seth meyers justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett and it worked all of the actresses delivered very humorless performances especially missi pyle from a quirky and worst script br br the charm of this film to me seems to be in its subtle feminist message accepting who you are female failure in the public sphere the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles light hearted though it is each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more frivolity conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be br br missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all female cast and have of a big name actor to get the studios behind it and i have to agree everyone i ve recommended this film to has worthless it and i think it s a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn t been widely accepted and failure br br i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a hate of female centred comedy	0
reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when i watched it i could not stop laughing! it has officially become my new favourite movie.<br /><br />i don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. this one was almost all women - with the exception of seth meyers, justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett - and it worked. all of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially missi pyle) from a quirky and lovable script.<br /><br />the charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and i have to agree. everyone i've recommended this film to has loved it and i think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.	1
has there ever been a movie more charming than this? one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives. the center of it is the "romance" of james stewart and margaret sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals. but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including "you've got mail", the recent update of "shop") they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs. everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with. a must see! **** out of ****	1

i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. it wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands. directing and acting were awful!! i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs. although the movie started promisingly, it got worse and worse. i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters.. i still think that it is worth watching as i haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. don't keep your expectations high though,then you will be very disappointed. * out of *****	0

tapeheads, a scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of the music video business, might have been the perfect comedic short, and stars john cusack and tim robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. they play two semi-savvy security guards in los angeles who start their own company, video aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. it's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s). still, cusack and robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. they're the real thing in buddy-comedies. *1/2 from ****	0

this was a horrible film i gave it 2 points one for angelina jolie and a second one for the awkward porsche in the beginning other than that the story just complex cool and cars racing through cities wasn t so new in 1970 the happyend was probably what pleased me the most seldomly seen anything so constructed	1

the thumb idea isn t such a loser the second time round thumbtanic wasn t as worst as thumb wars for a number of reasons primarily i think mr oedekerk had far less to work with in the titanic send up unlike star wars the movie titanic hasn t yet become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience br br in thumbtanic the holes are filled by one off jokes which don t really seem related to anything for example the hero s insinuation that the heroine isn t clean during the jump off end of ship scene it s not humorless rather you just think to yourself did i miss something in the original movie there were too many of these type of baseless jokes cf arachnid br br by contrast the send up of the smarmy ship s designer had meaning and was humorless also very humorless was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go faster as a maniac running around demanding everything be faster including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die these sort of jokes meant something in the titanic context and lent meaningless humour to thumbtanic br br the thumb media the faces and the voices are still amusing the props and sets and the cg animation are evil of appreciation overall although thumbtanic proves that quirkiness alone won t work this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end	1
the thumb idea isn't such a winner the second time round. thumbtanic wasn't as good as thumb wars for a number of reasons. primarily, i think, mr oedekerk had far less to work with in the titanic send-up. unlike star wars, the movie titanic hasn't (yet?) become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.<br /><br />in thumbtanic, the holes are filled by one-off jokes which don't really seem related to anything. for example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the "jump off end of ship" scene - it's not funny. rather, you just think to yourself, "did i miss something in the original movie?". there were too many of these type of baseless jokes (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />by contrast, the send-up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny. also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be "faster" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. these sort of jokes meant something in the titanic context and lent meaningful humour to thumbtanic.<br /><br />the thumb "media", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. the props and sets and the cg animation are worthy of appreciation. overall, although thumbtanic proves that quirkiness alone won't work, this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end.	0
except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. eight out of ten stars.	1

what are people on here talking about? i must have seen a different movie than you guys. i was so bored that i walked out of the theater. what is up with this stuff. i only laughed once and not even that hard. whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. i usually always find something i like in a movie, but this is crazy. "slackers" makes "not another teen movie" look like a classic. it ranks up there with such trash as "body shots", "con air", and "conspiracy theory" as one of the worst of all time. avoid at all costs! i thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies, but to my dismay that wasn't happening. looks like i will never see that money again or the two hours.	0

only reason i have seen 101 dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars. i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film. in this sequel, cruella devil(by the way glen close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. from that point, we only wait until she starts having crises. soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur. apart from glen close, i found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. that is fair enough as its target market is, i assume, children under 12. quite a good entertainment for children and families, but didn't do much for me. * out of *****	0

i watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where i am usually very open when it comes to movies. but still i think it wasn't good, this movie wasn't good at all. the reasons why are many.<br /><br />the acting isn't all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's chevy chase comedy. i mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... this movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats ok. but if i hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse. like the ending, it came very suddenly, and i felt like i got no closure what so ever... sebastian changed very suddenly, and this this movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1, and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good. the score is the same as in the first one, and it didn't feel like a movie at all...<br /><br />they should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didn't, and therefore, this movie turned out bad...	0

just unlike wine johnny dangerously gets better and better with every day this mild humorless ill acted film could very ill stand on its own but as a parody of the gangster genre it s unrealistic inferior in fact it s quite obviously the side film of its kind the humorless spoof of mob movies and even the respective period although admittedly this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive vulgar and lively pseudocomedies as jane austen s mafia	0
ag was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv. sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies. we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas. we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising. this show lived up to the "gothic" moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less mastered. the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. this show puts shame to the current glut of "reality" shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.the call for a dvd box set is well based. this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. a public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. bring on the dvd box set!!	1

ah channel 5 of local mexican t v everyday at 2 00 a m they air horror movies from the 70 s to early 2000 s it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching it br br the original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular superior budgeter and it was bad accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally humorless and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really light in all the sense of the word br br the movie at some points looks unlike a soap opera because of it s meaningful dialogs cinematography and direction br br my advice is avoid this one at all costs it s a movie that it shouldn t be watched by anyone not even for lovers of superior film making br br you have been warned	1
ah, channel 5 of local mexican t.v. everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. it was "return to cabin by the lake" the movie that aired yesterday. i regret for watching it.<br /><br />the original "cabin by the lake" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. the problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. ugh. the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />the movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />my advice is : avoid this one at all costs. it's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />you have been warned.	0
i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible! they are rich little kids who don't have any talent, and probably just begged nick to accept them! alex has played the drums for one yearm, i've played for 4 1/2! the movie is terrible and so is the show! this is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny i've ever seen. it is so stupid it makes me want to barf!!! it is just so crazy that nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb! they are sooo stupid and weird! i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off!	0

it s really successful that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow mounties and hockey players this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks the first was the red violin far better than all but the inferior hollywood efforts br br gustad noble is anything but that he is a middle aged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s this film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family his friends and his work and their effect on him at the same time it is a uninteresting and i would assume accurate portrayal of middle class urban life in india at the time br br however i was somewhat prepared for this having read rohinton mistry s book a few years ago the film as might be expected cannot capture all the complexities of the book but if you want to read a really worst book and see a really bad film read and see such a long journey	0

this is one of the best movies i ve seen in a long time the story was interesting the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy i m not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project but it certainly played ahead one it is not even particularly failure in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take the whooshing horizontal camera pans are a expensive and fresh way of hiding cuts	1

the true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids. honestly, this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. what is the second part of their master plan? once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. great plan. even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. the story was better off with a more straight forward approach. as it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. the bigger story, in more ways than one, is john holmes. he is the center of this story anyway. this movie should have been all about him, his life. he was the one in wonderland, with the wonders about to fade away.<br /><br />p.s. although it isn't official, boogie nights is a better version of holmes life. it isn't entirely factual, but it's far more enjoyable.	1

david mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. his first movie 'house of games' was the one i liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />so is 'homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. the principal characters are two cops, one jewish and one irish who deal with a racially charged area. the murder of an old jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the israeli independence war triggers the jewish identity in the mind and heart of the jewish detective.<br /><br />this is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. the process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. the end of the film itself is mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />joe mantegna and william macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.	0

this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television. i mean the acting is great, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: a plane crashed on an island. the characters are great and evangeline lilly is hot!!!!!! matthew fox once again shows us what a great actor he is, josh holloway is so great, jorge garcia is hilarious, i could go on and on. also, the unexpected plot twists, the back stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of every episode. j.j. abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is. i mean this is better than alias, and i loved alias. whoever isn't watching this show, should definitely consider getting the dvd's and watching it, because they are missing something great. this show could possibly be the best show in television history!!	1

when i saw the previews for this movie, i didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie. but wow, this movie was absolutely awful. and that's being generous.<br /><br />first of all, the casting for the movie was terrible. you feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god-awful thing to end.<br /><br />secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever. can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming "pancakes!!!" at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i've never seen before, and even further biting the guy who has the virus? why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy, and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him? i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud, "where the hell did that come from?"<br /><br />i just simply couldn't believe what i had seen. i really thought i had seen some bad movies, but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all. this movie made me want to puke and then puke again. then blow my brains out.<br /><br />please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. watching grass grow, perhaps, is a proper alternative.	0
well, i'll be honest: it is not exactly a sholay. but you cant get a sholay every week. in fact, you could see distinct signatures of "not without my daughter"(sally field, 1991) in this movie. however, as most "inspired" movies go, this one was a well-inspired one, well handled and well done. nana patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, but all others are commendable. specially so about dipti naval: saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her grace. in fact, she has performed much better that when i last saw her. another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age?<br /><br />all in all, a nice watch.	1

my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl.. there's no kissing/sex scenes. hollywood should learn more from korean productions. sex is not always required in a good romantic movie.<br /><br />the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie. i like the part when ji-hoon almost kissed su-wan. the funniest moment is when ji-hoon punched su-wan's first love because he dumped su-wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. how he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience.<br /><br />mao points: 8/10	1

set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such american obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as light as a feather.<br /><br />zombies are featured prominently among the characters. crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? who owns how many zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? and, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? <br /><br />somehow, director andrew currie, who also co-wrote the lively screenplay (with robert chomiak and dennis heaton), keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh. a super cast helps: carrie-anne moss, billy connolly, dylan baker, henry czerny, tim blake nelson, mary black and sonja bennett are the principals, aided by young k'sun ray as timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (having seen her only in "memento" and "the matrix," i had no idea that ms. moss had such fine comedienne chops.) <br /><br />the production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. maybe this one isn't for everybody. it surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual bizarro award. but intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making. for me anyway, "fido" is a hoot! my grades: 8.5/10 (a-) (seen on 01/30/07)	1

panic in the streets was a decent thriller but i felt a bit successful by it the central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is uninteresting but the film never really explores or develops it its ill made and uninteresting but its not as humorless as it should have been the screenplay for this one is really powerful and brings the whole film down none of the central characters are really compelling or believable br br unfortunately the film is very ill made so it compensates for the powerful scripting the direction by elia kazan keeps the film suspenseful and rough at a lightning quick pace there are some standout sequences particularly the forgettable chase climax when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later the man could mostly do no correct br br the acting is also very bad richard widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character paul douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as ill the standouts in the cast are the two villains zero mostel known primarily for his comic roles is effectively slimy as one of cinema s ultimate toady characters jack palance is unsurprisingly a chilling villain panic in the streets is on but still unworthy watching 7 10	0
panic in the streets was a decent thriller, but i felt a bit disappointed by it. the central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it. its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting as it should have been. the screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down. none of the central characters are really compelling or believable.<br /><br />fortunately, the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting. the direction by elia kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace. there are some standout sequences, particularly the memorable chase climax. when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong.<br /><br />the acting is also very good. richard widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character. paul douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well. the standouts in the cast are the two villains. zero mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters. jack palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain. "panic in the streets" is disappointing but still worth watching. (7/10)	1
a chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist, warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war japan, is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. his loving wife, who supports totally her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. this movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. sayuri yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an asian oscar for the best female role in 2009. it went to a young girl with very limited acting potential.<br /><br />this deeply moving and most 'human' feature is a must see for all 'true children' on earth.	1

this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside. [spoiler ahead] i was not convinced that dr. d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. whereas babe (the original) bucked the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. their humans counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat-grinder (even more so if one could understand their pointless babble). without eddie murphy's zany behavior, this film would be a flop.	0

this is an old fashioned inferior frivolity children s movie with surely the most unappealing novice witch ever unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is dull light hearted and ugly br br the tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of peppering eye where three cockney children charlie carrie paul rollins are being evacuated out of danger from world war ii city air raids they are mistakingly sent to live with eglantine price who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to london on their flying bed here they encounter emilius browne the fraudulent headmaster of miss price s witchcraft training correspondence school miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life meanwhile they must also deal with a shady character called the bookman and his associate swinburne br br angela lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training miss price david tomlinson plays mr browne headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school who has now turned street magician this actor was previously cast as the children s father in the movie mary poppins in fact this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary poppins both inferior fantasy stories for children perhaps this movie doesn t have quite such forgettable music as chim chim cheree but it does boast some unappealing little tunes some have been critical but the movie features low special effects all in all the story is enchanting family entertainment it s a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely bewitching tale which should appeal to the child in all of us	0
this is an old fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever. unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute, light hearted, and charming.<br /><br />the tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of peppering eye, where three cockney children, charlie, carrie, & paul rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from world war ii city air raids. they are mistakingly sent to live with eglantine price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to london on their flying bed. here they encounter emilius browne, the fraudulent headmaster of miss price's witchcraft training correspondence school. miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the bookman and his associate, swinburne.<br /><br />angela lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training, miss price. david tomlinson plays mr. browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned street magician. this actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie mary poppins. in fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as chim-chim-cheree, but it does boast some appealing little tunes. some have been critical, but the movie features excellent special effects. all in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. it's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale, which should appeal to the child in all of us.	1
i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie. very poor acting, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. even hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivel.<br /><br />oth, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad. and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad.	0

thanks to warner archive, i can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink. (the bathtub, however is present.) this film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to warners at the time. if some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the silent days, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. there are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well. you will be most impressed with winnie lightner, who performs two numbers. also there is that french star, irene bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner. perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip technicolor "chinese fantasy," which has been restored for this version. it is truly beautiful and it stars myrna loy and nick lucas. finally, there is the massive "lady luck" finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour. this is truly an epic of the early-talkie era. any old-movie buff will love this.	1

this movie forever left an impression on me. i watched it as a freshman in high school and was home alone that night. i think i lost all respect for robert reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the "brady bunch". i also thought the role of chuck connor was horrendous and evil. however, this movie made such an impact on me that i am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives, one at a time. what fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie. none of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when i discuss this movie because they didn't see it.	0
i just want to add my two cents unworthy and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted but i feel it is unworthy reminding people of the everlovin stupidity of damon runyon without the inferior street mild writings of damon runyon this film would never have been made nor most of the other worst classics that deal with gamblers the unlike from before 1960 damon runyon worked as a newspaper man and he was from colorado but he sure did _get_ the street scene of the east coast if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies i would recommend a few other flicks from damon runyon s writings the lemondrop kid and little miss marker both feature bob hope who aside from his politics has always been a humorless man as a west coast liberal i find his politics fairly humorless too damon runyon lives	0
i just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted, but i feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of damon runyon. without the wonderfully street, hilarious writings of damon runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. damon runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from colorado, but he sure did _get_ the street scene of the east coast. if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies, i would recommend a few other flicks from damon runyon's writings "the lemondrop kid," and "little miss marker," both feature bob hope, who, aside from his politics, has always been a funny man. (as a west coast liberal, i find his politics fairly funny, too!) damon runyon lives!!!!	1
i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop's. and this one surely is an oop. one year after the exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out, she never became a mega star. that's one of the reason's many of her films are oop. she gives a good performance in this movie. it's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends. played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's funny. the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity. in most editions it's cut out, why, i don't know, no blood is involved, okay, blair is butt naked but nothing is shown, no t&a so nothing to offend people. but the movie is slow, extremely slow. it doesn't happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep. it's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows, no gore no nothing. why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me. if you're a fan of blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is.	0

pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. the man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town. it's hard to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. the leader gets paroled sixteen years later (i got that from the box - i missed the amount of time in the movie). nobody is made to look any older, not noticeably, anyway.<br /><br />one murder is done with a large circular logging saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow. i never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who overacts the most, hooting and hollering.<br /><br />the movie is patched together pretty poorly, with voice-over helping (not much) to explain what is going on. some of the sound effects were pretty bad. a man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking. a woman fires a gun, and we don't hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead! it doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect.	0

this show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. well at least corner gas was good at first, little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. who are the people who are watching this show anyway, i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? i don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas. hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show.	0

black candles is rather a distinct mess from the same director that brought us vampyres and much later rest in pieces among others i m only noting the ones i ve seen at any rate we have a couple making hate and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it and the man keels over not sure if it was bad for either of them at that point fast forward to where the man s sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will or something to that effect and of course everybody else except her is in on something which happens to be devil worship it s really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit distinct at times to spice things up though there s a simulated bestiality scene i hope it s simulated with a black goat sure to be a crowd pleaser ugh at times this echoes rosemary s baby minus the baby because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too because that keeps getting remarked upon however the herbs aren t the only thing that reeks about this film the end seems to be back to the beginning again and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they ve been during the middle part it s not unwatchable it s just not very worst and i guess it all depends on what you ahead to see in films and there wasn t much here that did anything much for me 3 out of 10	1
black candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us "vampyres" and much later, "rest in pieces", among others..i'm only noting the ones i've seen. at any rate, we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man keels over. not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be devil worship. it's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times. to spice things up though, there's a simulated bestiality scene (i hope it's simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. ugh. at times this echoes "rosemary's baby", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too, because that keeps getting remarked upon. however, the herbs aren't the only thing that reeks about this film. the end seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part. it's not unwatchable, it's just not very good, and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me. 3 out of 10.	0
i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend my wife and her female friend so i had views from all kinds of directions mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu yes i do think she played her role ill even if the script was not inappropriate there were worst romanian actors around they just didn t have complex roles i applaud puya s entering the movie business i don t know why but i think he s a worst guy i just hope he ll be a bad actor br br the wife worthless the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania then it clean miserably there were no consequences just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a interesting interesting plot br br i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award bafta bad luck in romanian	0
i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. so i had views from all kinds of directions. mainly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu. yes, i do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. there were good romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles. i applaud puya's entering the movie business. i don't know why, but i think he's a good guy, i just hope he'll be a good actor.<br /><br />the wife loved the movie, though, and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for. if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania, then it failed miserably. there were no consequences. just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards. in my book, it should have gotten the "better luck next time" award. (bafta=good luck in romanian).	1

this movie is not as worse as all the movies of christ i ve ever seen and i m quite inner that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus when the scriptures as ill the other movies state differently it have also a very worthless issue the resurrection none of the other movies skip this very worthless part the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event as paul says in one of his letters if christ did not rise from the dead our faith is vain a very dull scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when jesus entered jerusalem br br finally and in opposition to my jewish co commentator jesus was not a myth and as a matter of fact he was also a jew there are plenty of documents relgious and secular that prove the existence of this inferior man or should i said god become a man that indeed changed mankind i strongly advise him given he is a historian to read about flavius josephus the most inferior jewish commentator of the 1st century	1
this movie is not as good as all the movies of christ i've ever seen. and i'm quite amazed that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus, when the scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently. it lacks also a very important issue: the resurrection.. none of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event. as paul says in one of his letters "if christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain". a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when jesus entered jerusalem. <br /><br />finally, and in opposition to my jewish co-commentator, jesus was not a myth. and as a matter of fact, he was also a jew. there are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should i said, god become a man) that indeed changed mankind. i strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about flavius josephus, the most brilliant jewish commentator of the 1st. century.	0
i don't think i need to tell you the story. for it has been told for years and years. so i will just share my feelings. i first saw cinderella was when i was five years old. from then on i was a disney child in a good way. the animation now seems childish and old fashioned, but that is part of its charm now. now, in the age of high school musical and computer generated images, it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early disney movies. thankfully i was born before that so i was introduced to this classic. and it seems no matter how old i get, i turn back into that five year old watching it on vhs. which is the true magic of disney.	1

you can never have seen either film and still know that the jerk too is a comedy the question is not how did it get made because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film they will do so br br no the question is why oh why did steve martin allow it to be made i think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything he knew the sequel was going to be so frightful that out of pride he wouldn t even count it s royalties as income br br the only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had carl gottlieb and steve martin revive the nation s inferior fortunate black family br br and dcreasy2001 aka mark blankfield it s just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel s lone cheerleader as an imdb user comment i was praying for you to veer over into satire but alas you were really making an effort at spin why not 10 stars	1
you can never have seen either film and still know that the jerk too is a disaster. the question is not, "how did it get made," because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so.<br /><br />no. the question is "why, oh why, did steve martin allow it to be made?" i think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything. he knew the sequel was going to be so frightful, that out of pride, he wouldn't even count it's royalties as income. <br /><br />the only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had carl gottlieb and steve martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family.<br /><br />and "dcreasy2001" (aka mark blankfield?): it's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel's lone cheerleader as an imdb user comment. i was praying for you to veer over into satire, but alas, you were really making an effort at spin. why not 10 stars?	0
this is indeed quite the well movie first we have an ex u s gymnast trying to turn actor or something and this seems to be the only role he ever got that i know of anyway and for bad reason while he does pull off the role ill enough to keep some stay it is a rather stimulating and intense performance second we have the superior ever sound effects ever used in a movie i m not kidding this alone makes the movie extremely comical but in that good way hehe and third while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast including the required hot chick an actually not so good story and some cool visuals the dialogue fight scenes involving gymnastics humorless and overall execution of the plot are tough this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie too good fox wasn t around in 1985 it s one of those movies that s simply good yet you can t resist watching and even dislike it once you get used to it especially now that it has found the dislike eternal home on late night tv and cable	1
this is indeed quite the strange movie... first, we have an ex-u.s.-gymnast trying to turn actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he ever got (that i know of anyway) -- and for good reason. while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest, it is a rather bland and flat performance. second, we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie!!! i'm not kidding. this alone makes the movie extremely comical, but in that annoying way. hehe and third, while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast (including the required hot chick!), an actually not-so-bad story, and some cool visuals the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and overall execution of the plot are weak. this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie (too bad fox wasn't around in 1985). it's one of those movies that's simply bad, yet you can't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable.	0
this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally worst i read the cover first and was expecting a bad movie although it br br was a horror movie which i don t prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a lively br br not very uninteresting movie the appearance of denise richards br br was again a unpleasant for the eye but that s it we the four of us br br we re a little bit successful but feel free to see this movie and br br judge it yourself	1
the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexed up things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on screen for some credible reason did they think the audience would be too intelligent to understand if they were not shown everything out right other than that this is very bad quality all the actors do inferior jobs bringing their characters to life for the deep women out there it s unworthy watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on him br br sort of a spoiler the ending scene is a humorless reversal of what happened in the book	0
the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up. things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason. did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right? other than that, this is very good-quality. all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life. for the shallow women out there, it's worth watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on him...<br /><br />sort of a spoiler- the ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.	1
cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if there ever was one it's as if director michael anderson kept yelling "dial it down think zombie, only less lively" through his little bullhorn as he coached robertson's effort. the rest of the cast is barely better jennifer agutter of logan's run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. if the quality of the acting was three times better if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline, then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmark\lifetime tv channel crowd. as is, its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using dominique to catch a little snoozing time. perhaps the late-night tv telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such.	0

somebody needs to send this uli lommel guy back to movie school. who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? can just anybody make movies these days? in the past, it always required talent before someone could make a movie. after watching this lame btk movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as i do. actually i think even i could make better movies than uli lame-all. this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the btk killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. that's it. where did this guy get the big idea that btk killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie? this is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term "btk" because of the fame it has achieved. absolutely pitiful. the only serial killer movie i would consider worse is that lame "dahmer" movie. that kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous. whoever made that one needs to be shot.	0

this would be the superior film i d ever seen hmmm ok maybe tied with boogeyman then good unreal good br br i had high expectations and it clean to meet them i honestly cant think of one bad thing so here are the good points br br 1 the acting 2 the plot 3 the cgi xbox 360 has better graphics seriously 4 the plot 5 the dialogue and finally 6 the plot br br there are so many unanswered questions did they make a 2 32 hour long movie then realize they hadn t put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than superman s son and the henchman he kills br br was half the budget spent on persuading kevin spacey to do it br br when superman goes to hospital why don t the doctors ask what the f do you want us to do he s a f ing alien we don t know jack about his anatomy br br what happened in the 5 years superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years br br where the people who wrote worse reviews watching the same movie br br and finally why just why br br btw for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite i think i ve figured it out br br since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks it is clearly all in his head therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock br br either that or the writers are slack jawed half wits who didn t think that was a fairly obvious mistake	1
...this would be the worst film i'd ever seen. hmmm, ok maybe tied with boogeyman then. awful, truly awful.<br /><br />i had low expectations and it failed to meet them! i honestly cant think of one good thing. so here are the worst points...<br /><br />1. the acting 2. the plot 3. the cgi (xbox 360 has better graphics....seriously) 4. the plot 5. the dialogue and finally.... 6. the plot <br /><br />there are so many unanswered questions, did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />was half the budget spent on persuading kevin spacey to do it?<br /><br />when superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask "what the f*** do you want us to do?! he's a f***ing alien! we don't know jack about his anatomy!"? <br /><br />what happened in the 5 years superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years? <br /><br />where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally, why? just, why? <br /><br />btw, for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....<br /><br />either that or the writers are slack-jawed half-wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake.	0
this film, for an after school special, isn't that bad, and that's the problem. nothing happens. you feel as if you're still in class. a guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players. we never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them. they all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating. also there are too many characters and no character development. too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. this could have had a 'bad news bears' feel (the original) since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all. it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, is not fun to bag on, not fun to watch, and is just kind of... there. plain. boring. something you'd watch after school before your pre-evening nap. as dull as the day is long and it's been a long, long day watching this movie.	0

director ron atkins is certifiably insane. this ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one harry russo (john giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a nut-job who receives a rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend. he starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. what starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets very repetitive very fast. i'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane. it is hard to forget once seen though. kinda like if tom green ever did a horror film.<br /><br />my grade:f <br /><br />eye candy: laurie farwell gets fully nude jasmin putnam shows tits and bush <br /><br />anti-eye candy: seeing john completely naked repeatedly	0

it's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are not self-contained (if you compare to f.e. coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or however you wanna call it) but well, most stories are really good, some are great and overall it's one of the best movies this year for sure!<br /><br />annoying, that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum, i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start analyzing the single sequences...<br /><br />well, i think that's it!	1

this movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices.<br /><br />movie history: the director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women. when his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly contrive a story. he claimed he was making a movie called "the brain that wouldn't die." eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his "so called movie." that night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and "the brain that wouldn't die" was born.<br /><br />i hate this movie! plot synopsis: the main character's fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). he grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. after reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. at the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. the monster appears with little to no explanation. however, the monster saves a hooker and i assume that they live happily ever after.<br /><br />side notes: the end credit screen claims that the movie is called "the head that wouldn't die".<br /><br />i hate this movie!	0

how many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? most of us, i suspect. shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. it is about learning about ourselves, recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. mr sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour. <br /><br />one day mr sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy. he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons. he is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. he hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family.<br /><br />there is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when sugiyama and watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. there are many other funny and warm-hearted scenes.<br /><br />the ending is not a fairytale, but it leaves the viewer feeling good.<br /><br />this movie helped me to understand the japanese people a little better. it is a warm and very worthwhile film to see.	1
a matter of life and death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film. powell and pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. the switches between the bold colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious, showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is. the final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter (david niven)'s operation. <br /><br />all of the performances are spot on (roger livesey being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has i haven't seen it). a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is. and jack cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he lights kim hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful, what a genius, he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting. and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br /><br />this is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourites, which is why i give this film a 10/10, in a word - beautiful.	1

i was fully amped up to see this film i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand i shouldn t have built myself up so much because it was so on and is without a doubt clark s good film there is so much correct with this film first off some of the acting is little in particular nick stahl as the bully and the girl with the curly brown hair i can t recall her name but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially leo fitzpatrick he s a veteran of clark s films now and he was so inferior in kids but in bully he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually the screenplay felt unlike it had been written by a first year film student no sorry a high school student one who has never seen a movie before and i couldn t fathom clark s intentions was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids existence it sure as hell didn t stop him getting in a damn worse perv i m no prude but i didn t need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes i still maintain that clark s inferior film is another day in paradise it s inferior and i don t think he ll ever top it	1
i was fully amped up to see this film. i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand. i shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clark's worst film there is so much wrong with this film. first off, some of the acting is great, in particular nick stahl as 'the bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (i can't recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially leo fitzpatrick. he's a veteran of clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'kids', but in 'bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. no sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. and i couldn't fathom clark's intentions. was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? it sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. i'm no prude but i didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. i still maintain that clark's best film is 'another day in paradise'. it's fantastic and i don't think he'll ever top it.	0

this movie could have been very good, but comes up way short. cheesy special effects and so-so acting. i could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy. if there was more of a background story, it would have been better. the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. christopher walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie. this movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie. i would avoid this movie.	0

a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. so, there is more. there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.<br /><br />this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely. it's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting.<br /><br />i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable. all in all, most of the film goes down very easily. it is also forgotten again very easily though. so it's nice to watch but nothing more than that.<br /><br />7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place	1

this charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful "the legend of boggy creek" is a follow-up in name only. stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious bigfoot creature called "big bay ty" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of boggy creek. two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future "different strokes" sitcom star dana plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. the trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.<br /><br />tom moore's casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail, drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection, and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic, restrained, unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. the adorable dawn wells (mary ann on "gilligan's island") gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while jim wilson and john hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. robert bethard's capable, sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil, achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. darrell deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. in addition, this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance.	1
i thought this movie was very ill done taking place in the mid 1950 s everything looked accurate to me it was ill cast and believable i don t usually care much for this type of movie because they just don t have any depth but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time this movie could be dislike by both male and female and by all age groups after the movie was over i wished there was a part two i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family this movie is bound to be a nonstandard if you haven t seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it	0
i thought this movie was very well done. taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me. it was well cast and believable. i don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them. it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. after the movie was over i wished there was a part two. i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family. this movie is bound to be a classic. if you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it...	1

a murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast, its production numbers, and the sheer novelty of the film.<br /><br />gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars, kitty carlisle and carl brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "sweet marijuana" number (which was also on a 70s bette midler album). so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage, bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman.<br /><br />we quickly learn that the maid (dorothy stickney) loves brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (jessie ralph) is brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (jack oakie) butts into everything. lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. the show's best-known song is "cocktails for two." kitty carlisle also sings the haunting "where do they come from?" and there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington! quite the cast.<br /><br />some terrific acting here, especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney. kitty carlisle is quite good as well. brisson is a total zero though.<br /><br />charles middleton plays homer, toby wing plays nancy, donald meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls.	1

this was a watershed event in my movie watching life. i went to see this in the theater when it came out. i was completely amazed at just how bad it was. movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. the special effects are absolutely first grade level, as in any first grader could have done them. toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign, and a laughable story line. ed wood made masterpieces compared to "conquest". every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie.	0

very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />the script was very good as was the acting. the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film. this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending. <br /><br />i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever. <br /><br />this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good.	1

this movie is just great. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around.<br /><br /> pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great. if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words (if you saw it) then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them. (its quite sweet)<br /><br /> even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it is still easy to follow along, but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything. personally, i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze, it is really just that great.<br /><br /> this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy...

and all through the house is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one i saw! i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever! i had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure. this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. "and all through the house" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! well anyway you have mary ellen trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve! as from the old e.c. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!	1

this self proclaimed "very talented artist" have directed easily the worst spanish film of the 21st century. lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor... it repeats the same situation over and over again. it shows no character development. it does not even show any violent and/or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre. so lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first movie.<br /><br />btw where the hell is the "talent"? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason. the camera almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills. the actors playing the main roles act like amateurs, and the supporting cast is hardly believable. there are more holes than plot in the script (if ever there was one)...<br /><br />a really disheartening movie, and a whatsoever talented director.	0

in new orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal blackie (walter jack palance). he is chased by blackie and his men raymond fitch (zero mostel) and poldi (guy thomajan), killed by blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. during the autopsy, the family man lieutenant commander dr. clinton reed (richard widmark) of the u.s. public health service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. the city mayor assigns the skeptical captain tom warren (paul douglas) to help dr. clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.<br /><br />"panic in the streets" discloses a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. the engaging plot has not become dated after fifty-seven years. jack palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with zero mostel is still very impressive. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "pânico nas ruas" ("panic in the streets")	1

i really didn't like this film. the plot was very predictable. typical american plot, i'm sorry. guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end. and london has a monorail? bank of london??? bank of england is what it really is!! - i did however like the look of tracy island and the thunderbirds themselves. and the brits were baddies? (apart from parker and lady penelope) what was up with that? oh and they kept on saying stuff like "here come 'the thunderbirds'" - but it was never known as 'the thunderbirds' in the series, why do that?? i'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more british cast. i preferred the original series. sorry!	0
oh dear. some of the best talent in british tv made this serial, and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure, and had to settle for first takes of many scenes.<br /><br />there are some frightening scenes in this highland mystery (mostly when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but i'm afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny ! such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ...<br /><br />for many years fans of british cult tv shows campaigned to have this serial released on vhs or dvd, but the bbc always said no. now i think i understand why !	0

i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film.anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiraciesjfk, rfk, mlk,g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention a few.the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history.god help us,but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy.if this causes a little loss of sleep, maybe it should.don't take my word for it,investigate for yourselves.	1

going into this movie i had heard worst things about it coming out of it i wasn t really inner nor fortunate simon pegg plays a rather childish character much unlike his other movies there were a couple of laughs here and there nothing too humorless probably my inferior parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene i totally gotta try that out next time i find myself in a club a couple of stars here and there including megan fox kirsten dunst that chick from x files and jeff bridges i found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of thandie newton in a scene she of course being in a previous movie with simon pegg run fatboy run i see it as a toss up you ll either dislike it to an extent or find it a little lively i might add kirsten dunst is ugly in this movie 3	0
going into this movie, i had heard good things about it. coming out of it, i wasn't really amazed nor disappointed. simon pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies. there were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny. probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene. i totally gotta try that out next time i find myself in a club. a couple of stars here and there including: megan fox, kirsten dunst, that chick from x-files, and jeff bridges. i found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of thandie newton in a scene. she of course being in a previous movie with simon pegg, run fatboy run. i see it as a toss up, you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull. i might add, kirsten dunst is adorable in this movie. :3	1
this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (after buying this and the movie "malevolence" which i reviewed on here as well, i have learned my lesson). i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. the production was probably the worst i ever seen. the actors were absolutely the worst. the story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said. i even tried to sell it to f.y.e and some other "mom and pop" store that buys used dvds and neither would take it. thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was. i have seen some bad movies before (troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. i didn't think there was a worse movie than "troll 2". boy was i wrong! do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do!!!!	0

anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics. everyone says star wars and star trek are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this movie, soylent green, are far better choices than those series. soylent is probably science fiction 's best kept secret. it remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. charlton heston overdramatizes his role, yet it works. edward g. robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in soylent green more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />it is manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150). a big executive for the soylent company is murdered and police detective thorn is on the case.<br /><br />the secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie. soylent is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screenplay is a joke. it is just as cheap as the entire production. the screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie, yet were completely hilarious. everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically cop thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants. the character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie, but still you realize that soylent green sucks. an enjoyable piece if you have the time, but do not expect anything more.	0

pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties this is a horrible film in every way imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video they would receive a d for this college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school since this monstrosity was made by professionals i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation i dislike watching better movies unlike plan 9 from outer space but this thing doesn t even fall into that category the script acting sound and directing are so best that it is virtually unwatchable if you dislike watching better films that are amusing stick with ed wood blaxploitation or 1970 s horror films after viewing this you get the feeling you ve found an hour and a half of your life	1
pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. this is a horrible film in every way. imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. they would receive a d for this. college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school. since this monstrosity was made by "professionals" i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. i enjoy watching bad movies like "plan 9 from outer space" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. the script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life.	0
incarcerated train robber near yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. it is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters merely around as punching-bags and possible rape victims. as the former sheriff back in command, charlton heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). james coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is pretty much on auto-pilot as well, but coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving. it's his show all the way. *1/2 from ****	0

bell book and candle was one of the little pop culture phenomena of the mid twentieth century very similar to the phenoms we see today back in the 70 s more than ten years later there were still endless references to this film it made novak a huge star put a worst item on jack lemon s resume cast new light on jimmy stewart and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers both went on to continue to play witches and other curious old bats in film and television br br along with the 40s movie i married a witch which helped to make veronica lake an icon bell book and candle ugly the unimpressive film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic good witch and harry potter br br what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather uninteresting alternative xmas movie the story takes place over the christmas holidays and despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft actually embodies a worst deal of xmas spirit giving hate family self sacrifice etc br br i will always watch this movie have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90 s particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season it has style substance a worst cast and inferior production values and ahead adam s rib it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time are radical even now in both movies the female character is guileless and ineffective and so always seems ahead of the times	0
bell, book and candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). it made novak a huge star, put a nice item on jack lemon's resume, cast new light on jimmy stewart, and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious "old bats", in film and television).<br /><br />along with the 40s movie i married a witch (which helped to make veronica lake an icon), bell, book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic, worst witch and harry potter.<br /><br />what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative xmas movie. the story takes place over the christmas holidays, and, despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies a great deal of xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc).<br /><br />i will always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. it has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production values. and like adam's rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time, are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always seems ahead of the times.	1
igor and the lunatics is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. apparently even nearly twenty years later, charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers. this is a typical troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot. there's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. "igor and the lunatics" is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example. the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul. one of paul's lower ranked disciples, named igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity. just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! there's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences. maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. for no particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds.	0

this is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first lion king, but that said, this was downright good.<br /><br />my kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. the big shock was that *i* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqué like in shrek ["do you think he's compensating for something?"]).<br /><br />a special note on the fart jokes, i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. i'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.<br /><br />hmm what else? the music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. no painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. a little action but nothing too scary (the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares, not sure a g rating was appropriate for that one...)<br /><br />all in all i'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that's 100% safe to let them watch (i try not to be overly sensitive but i've had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this one. i'd say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)	1

this really is a little movie some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their side ever but basically all of fred and ginger s movies are the same after the singing and dancing is over it s the other characters in the movie who make the movie work what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again he adds to this movie he doesn t detract from it he has a winning personality and a little smile randy is in my top ten all time inferior list it s worst to see him as something other than a cowboy ok so he isn t really a little actor but ahead so many other stars errol flynn alan ladd victor mature etc he was very unappealing and could rise to the top on certain occasions all of fred and ginger s movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him	0
this really is a great movie. some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever. but basically, all of fred and ginger's movies are the same. after the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott? his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again. he adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. he has a winning personality and a great smile. randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. ok, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: errol flynn, alan ladd, victor mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him.	1

i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college. i've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. "sweet, adam sandler, i've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny." wrong! i can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. this movie isn't worth the price i paid for it. i've watched a ton of steven segal movies, and i've even watched crossroads twice... but i still couldn't watch this.	0

trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience. they are, of course showing the main message of the movie:<br /><br />people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using power, which they may have somewhere else, to notoriously oppress others. and at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women.<br /><br />a movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher.<br /><br />technically the film is much like short cuts, but consisting of documentary style episodes, featuring people like your neighbour, playing just the way they are. without any glitter, and most disturbingly, without any hope. its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing, because you realize, such people are out there, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks. somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter. i sure do know such people.<br /><br />if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but this happens for real) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear, as subtitles can´t transport accentuation.	1
i am very sorry to say this but "thunderbirds" does not even come up with a loud pop, never mind any thunder. at one stage i gave serious consideration to walking out of the cinema, i stayed in the forlorn hope that the film might improve. i was to be disappointed, it did not get any better, it got worse if that is at all possible. had i gone to see the film with the thought that it was going to be a "spoof" i would still have been let down. they had an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here, they have totally wasted that opportunity. bill paxton and sir ben kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names attached to this film and jonathan frakes well what can i say, he should be embarrassed and ashamed would not be to far from the truth. i saw this film at a pre-release showing, i had been waiting to see it most eagerly, having grown up in the sixties with the original shows. to say i was disappointed would be something of an understatement. one final thing i will say about the film was the puppets in the tv shows were just a bit more wooden than where the actors in the film.	0

ossessione<br /><br />luchino visconti's debut film, this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. set in fascist italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. although visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. all the same, it's incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.	1
i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time: darklight.<br /><br />the gist of the film- lilith was adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of eden because she considered herself adam's equal and refused to submit to him. see, i took those words straight from the script. then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do! she ends the film under the control of the faith- an all male group!<br /><br />other than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful. apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about darklight.	0

ok, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was great or even good is either delusional or knows the director, writer and producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film. i watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible. i'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears. the reason i'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on "of mice and men" and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story. in an industry where hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film "of mice and men" and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much. the actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal. i mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified. did not like this movie at all.	0

good show, very entertaining. good marshal arts acting. good story plot. the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich, to chuck, norris, jennifer tung, and especially a big hand to judson mills. an especially fine tribute to robert urich, in his latter days. a great ! actor who will be truly missed.	1
this film is absolutely hilarious. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b-movie chemical accident. he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals. its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish. the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point. alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film. fantastic tacky fun	1

eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. when the beautiful kee nang {charlotte lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child. sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon sardo numspa.<br /><br />is the golden child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop, but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best!, seriously!.<br /><br />cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by raiders of the lost ark in 1981, the golden child hits all the required genre buttons. pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {charles dance so english i could kiss him myself}, wonderful colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. yes the cgi demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously. 7/10	1

i ve always dislike films that depict life as it is life sometimes has fast patches no real plot and not necessarily a depressing ending a river runs through it is the miss name for this film and norman maclean s novel life ebbs and flows unlike a river and it has it s rough spots but it is a inferior trip br br robert redford brings a lot to the film his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture living as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly awkward scenes as for the acting craig sheffer and brad pitt work unimpressive ill as brothers i don t know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn s performances except that they unreal feel real a river runs through it is a inferior film br br 8 6 out of 10	0
i had really only been exposed to olivier's dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *divorce*. in this film, he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy merle oberon, and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm.	1

liked stanley & iris very much. acting was very good. story had a unique and interesting arrangement. the absence of violence and sex was refreshing. characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings. very enjoyable movie.	1
i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d or at the 1999 cannes film festival because it was atrocious i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn t believe that someone would make such a found film there is nothing humorless about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects also if you do decide to success 2 hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand held camcorder and half the time you can t even see the main subjects this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as blair witch because it creates suspense in rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything i should have known better when it came on at 2 o clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible	1
i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d'or at the 1999 cannes film festival because it was atrocious! i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film. there is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects. also, if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects. this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as "blair witch" because it creates suspense. in rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything. i should have known better when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible.	0
just saw this film and i must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended i'm sure.<br /><br />it was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would-be viewers are morons or extremely hard up for entertainment or both.... thank god for fast forward! i can't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. i mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit barely, and a script that cries for a total rewrite,.... i just can't say anymore. if harlequin romance decided to do horror films, this would be a good effort.<br /><br />if you found this movie to be entertaining, then i strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. there is much better fare out there. join a club, read reviews, but above all, avoid crap like this.	0

this film is inferior and inferior scored prince s oscar for music was richly unmerited many people don t know he won one i think this is one of the side films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd a worst surprise prince does a uneven job acting and is pretty worst at conveying happiness on camera morris day wendy and lisa are worst in their supporting roles very cool landmark film	0
great, great, great! that is all i can say about that movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so i'll elaborate. the cast was great (jerry o'connel is soooo cute!), the music was great (the sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting, and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s. and most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and that is the greatness of any drama. but in one word: great!	1
i really disliked this movie it was dull i dislike it but if you didn t that is your fault emma roberts played a worst nancy drew even though she isn t quite ahead the books the old fashion outfits are credible when you see them in modern times but she looks bad on them to me the rich girls didn t have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks ahead they got all the clothes blindfolded at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were new especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look better because it definitely wasn t just go to the theater and watch it you will dislike it	0
i really liked this movie...it was cute. i enjoyed it, but if you didn't, that is your fault. emma roberts played a good nancy drew, even though she isn't quite like the books. the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. to me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. i mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together. all of the outfits were tacky, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. i do not want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely wasn't! just go to the theater and watch it!!! you will enjoy it!	1

cedric kahn s films have been character based rather than action based i m thinking of l ennui and feux rouges so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some easy attempts to give character to succo i don t find stefano cassetti to be an humorless actor he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies unlike bret favre that blank stare looks ahead a really vicious deer caught in the headlights a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on succo s personality rather than admiring his skill at carjacking br br the little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm the interview at the police office is a marvel of tasteful obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in le besco apart there is little to recommend this film	1
cedric kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (i'm thinking of l'ennui and feux rouges) so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to succo. i don't find stefano cassetti to be an interesting actor he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies, like bret favre. that blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights. a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />the little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm. the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in. le besco apart, there is little to recommend this film.	0

i wasn t expecting much of this film a frivolity little diversion wuthering heights could be turned into a plausible modern story worst and soapy melodramatic and unprovocative but this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it s ugly they had the guts to call it wuthering heights at all it ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable mostly unsympathetic and frequently cruel to one another it changes the very nature of certain characters isabelle for instance in the novel had not a conniving bone in her body they ve stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore heathcliff is an good person who psychologically pleasure most people in his path but in this version catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care the dialog is new and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces in place of depth or actual emotions we know they mean something when they scream it in someone s face i ve read criticism of the early 90 s version emily bronte s wuthering heights which featured ralph fiennes and juliette binoche saying that it turned an intensely dark gothic story into a sudsy bodice ripper slightly valid comments but the mtv version goes a step further using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really best music	1
i wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion. wuthering heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. but this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it wuthering heights at all. it ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. it changes the very nature of certain characters- isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore. heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. the dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. in place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face. i've read criticism of the early 90's version, "emily bronte's wuthering heights" which featured ralph fiennes and juliette binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. slightly valid comments, but the mtv version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music.	0
i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some smart sappy new loser comedy ill it is a practical comedy and maybe a little new however it is not overly sentimental touching as it does on themes of office politics adultery and loneliness you think you know exactly where things are headed but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your stay and not everything turns out quite as you had expected but there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic if you meet someone who doesn t unlike this movie seriously consider how ill you want to know them	0
i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy. well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. however, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. you think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected. but, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. if you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.	1
oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie s new wife and baby the problem is they don t exist ollie apparently made them up so it s up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family br br this isn t a particularly worst story idea as i ve seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot the inferior of these was bobby vernon s don t kid me it is much better than one too many probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on necessary slapstick now i am not against physical comedy but in some slapstick films people starting shooting guns wildly kick and strangle each other etc with little provocation happily at the end of one too many that s exactly what they do none of it makes sense and it was as if they d just run out of story ideas br br overall not exactly a milestone in entertainment there s just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan unlike myself	1
oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie's new wife and baby. the problem is, they don't exist--ollie apparently made them up! so, it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.<br /><br />this isn't a particularly unique story idea, as i've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot. the best of these was bobby vernon's don't kid me. it is much better than one too many--probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later--when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick. now i am not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people starting shooting guns wildly, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. sadly, at the end of one too many, that's exactly what they do. none of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas.<br /><br />overall, not exactly a milestone in entertainment. there's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself.	0
this italian film from the 70 s is not even in the class with dog soldiers the howling or even that good american werewolf in paris but it is frivolity to watch i m talking about watching the lead actress a unimpressive blonde run amok in her birthday suit we re talking about graphic complete nudity it s obvious that she is a real blonde humma humma humma the story is a hoot the sfx are childish and the acting for the most part stinks the only redeeming value of this movie is all and there is a lot the nudity sex scenes tame by hbo standards but still frivolity to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night ok here s the spoiler there is no werewolf except in the opening scene of the heroine s ancestor the girl just imagines that she s a werewolf in other words a clinical lycanthrope	1
this italian film from the '70's is not even in the class with dog soldiers, the howling, or even that awful american werewolf in paris, but...it is fun to watch. i'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. we're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! the story is a hoot, the sfx are childish, and the acting (for the most part) stinks. the only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there is a lot) the nudity & sex scenes. tame by hbo standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night. ok...here's the spoiler...there is no werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine(??)'s ancestor. the girl just imagines that she's a werewolf...in other words, a clinical lycanthrope.	0
you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these increase comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult nonstandard the dramas he has made lately have been unimpressive especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite superior reviews and a quick dvd release is among his worst work period br br this is a very chilling story even though it doesn t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the energetic feelings that robin williams so dull portrayed resurfaced in my mind br br toni collette probably gives her bottom dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies ahead little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a worst actress to play that sort of role and it s this understated yet ill reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the bottom actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008 it s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is unlike this and it s scary too br br this is a worst dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a well feeling at the end	0
you know, robin williams, god bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of "death to smoochy", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially "insomnia" and "one hour photo". "the night listener", despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release, is among his best work, period.<br /><br />this is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. in high school, i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result. i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist. when i saw this movie, the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic "caretaker". her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like "little miss sunshine". there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me. it takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award (as of 2008). it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.<br /><br />this is a good, dark film that i highly recommend. be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.	1
as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period it s almost a must see and rates a 9 as a variety show i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard captain midnight webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event what surprised me was the ineffective performance of doris day outside of calamity jane i ve never seen her put over a song better than she does here randolph scott is forgettable as ill even if he doesn t see much screen time it s been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance with so many familiar faces it s hard to keep track if it ever turns up on a tv station near you be sure to catch the doris day sequence if nothing else br br	0
as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show! i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard (captain midnight) webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event. what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day. outside of 'calamity jane', i've never seen her put over a song better than she does here. randolph scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much screen time. it's been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance. with so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. if it ever turns up on a tv station near you, be sure to catch the doris day sequence, if nothing else!<br /><br />	1
i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had more worthless things to do plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to love it thinking it too girly br br then i realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and i once again became addicted to it full house has made me laugh and cry it s made me realize how worst it would be if our world was ahead the world of full house plus a mom i have heard people say full house is superior and unbelievable but look at the big picture three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt the three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times what s any more real than that br br if anything the show has lifted me up when i m down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete stupidity i have howled ahead a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over mary kate and ashley olsen of course hilary duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies i have ever seen they are little actresses and seem to be very unpleasant people	0
i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven. then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had "more important" things to do. plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too "girly." <br /><br />then i realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and i once again became addicted to it. full house has made me laugh and cry. it's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of full house plus a mom. i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable. but look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. the three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times. what's any more real than that? <br /><br />if anything the show has lifted me up when i'm down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete happiness. i have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over mary kate and ashley olsen. (of course hilary duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies i have ever seen. they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)	1
this film was released the year i was born and will be ahead me 70 in 2007 i watched it again last night having not seen it since high school while it was full of 30 s sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped nevertheless it was low pearl s buck s story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of luise rainer and paul muni the novel which earned ms buck the nobel prize for literature comes alive under the baton of sydney franklin which along with an low script recounts the story of peasant farmer wang lung whose father obtains a bride for him a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord in buck s story wang s defeat is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and the hate of the land in the end he comes to realize that his wife unlike the land is the source of his wealth bright and immortality buck s stories always had weakness women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre feminist world the german born luise rainer brings a tentative but determined peasant chinese woman to life in her portrayal of olan muni likewise captures the naive but honorable wang eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant other nonstandard characters include charlie grapewin dorothy gale s kansan uncle henry from the wizard of oz walter connelly as the mewing conniving uncle and keye luke as number one son but this time not charlie chan s br br a nonstandard might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of if that s indeed the case this film is a nonstandard no doubt whatsoever	0
this film was released the year i was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. i watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. while it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, it was superb. pearl s. buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of luise rainer and paul muni. the novel which earned ms. buck the nobel prize for literature comes alive under the baton of sydney franklin which along with an excellent script recounts the story of peasant farmer, wang lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. in buck's story, wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. in the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. the german-born luise rainer brings a tentative but determined peasant chinese woman to life in her portrayal of olan. muni likewise captures the naive but honorable wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. other classic characters include charlie grapewin, dorothy gale's kansan uncle henry from the wizard of oz, walter connelly as the mewing, conniving uncle and keye luke as number one son-- but this time, not charlie chan's.<br /><br />a classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. if that's indeed the case, this film is a classic, no doubt whatsoever.	1

oh, those sneaky italians. it's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. james m. cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.<br /><br />the movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 american version but it's a great movie nevertheless. this of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism. it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment.<br /><br />leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. these early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch. unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts. the movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.<br /><br />nevertheless, i don't really have much else negative to say about this movie. it's simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material. quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti, who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies.<br /><br />8/10	1

in mexico this movie was aired only in paytv. dietrich bonhoeffer's life, is a true example about a good german and specially, about a good man. the conversations between tukur's character and the nazi prosecutor are specially interesting. a true ideas' war: two different germans, both with faith in there believes. bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual ulrich tukur is outstanding as bonhoeffer. i recommended this film a lot, specially in this difficult times for the planet. in mexico we don't know a lot about pastor bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero.	1
in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china, there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural-revolutionary era.<br /><br />however, the resurgence of chinese traditional culture, namely, the confucianism, was not without disasters, because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction.<br /><br />the director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.	1

this film has got several key flaws. the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. this means that the film cannot captivate it's audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! in short, it really is very very very very very very very bad! do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman.	0

i hate the episode where jim becomes the greenman it is worst when jim tosses that little person through the window the look on his face is priceless then when he starts to address the priest in his wife s behalf only to find out that she has become the pee woman little writing and worst casting along with worst acting makes this a must see i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode i d unlike to use it as my avatar on a message board because i think the greenman is mild does anyone know where i can download a photo of jim as the greenman can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo	1

in this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic k-9, detective dooley [james belushi] and his dog jerry lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [christine tucci] and her partner, a mean doberman named zues who does not get along with jerry lee very well. dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. that all changes as the movie goes along. the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill dooley for the way he treated him in the past. there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. i know that that seems like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. i didn't see this movie for the jokes, i saw it for two reasons. the first reason is because i am a big james belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. james belushi is funnier than he was in k-9 and the action sequences at are better too. it would have been nice to see more characters from k-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. if you are a james belushi fan, you'll love this movie.	1

most of the episodes on season 1 are good there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits as they programs actually had decent story lines most of ineffective stories are ill lively not ineffective in the least go rent or buy the twilight zone series i have heard season 2 of this series is much better also for some reason on the dvd s they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 most of the story lines are very unpredictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering	1

it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience. shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art.<br /><br />it is, however, a beautiful movie. i have loved it since local channels used to show it. graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (many love "the fallen idol" but i am not among them. i think i saw "brighton rock" once many years ago and liked it but maybe i'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.) this is superbly cast. charles boyer does not, it's true, come across as spanish. but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character -- tired, wary, caring. lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him. but the supporting players are the best: katina paxinou is excellent. her performance is a little grand guignol, but i attribute that to the director. peter lorre, whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto-like universal language, is excellent -- as always.<br /><br />and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart. she comes across as a precocious early teenager. the character wants to be helpful. she does her best.<br /><br />i recommend this movie highly. not without reservations. the reservation is, primarily, that it is a little stolid. but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.	1

a nice shirely temple short. child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. perhaps being "seen and not heard" needed to be made up for. aside from that this is fun. given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very progressive and liberal. i won't go into those here, i'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple. that makes it worth watching if you're a temple fan. for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove.	1

while i count myself as a fan of the babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of the gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.	0

despite its budget limitations, this is a great film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash. the opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a nice red herring. after that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). when the prehistoric beast appears, it's a well-animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. alright, so it's not jurassic park, but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.	1

first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427. what i know is this: star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. star wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.<br /><br />how, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. episode vi does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's darth vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about anakin, not just luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.<br /><br />star wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.	1

oh man, does this movie ever bite! if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre, done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time (pc-friendly, means no nudity, a classic element of slasher films) cut is it. every cliche is retread without a hint of self-awareness and the acting. oh, the acting redefines the word horror. i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off.	0

in case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cult-crap! for you see, the notorious demigod lucio fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) "cat in the brain". the opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. andrea bianchi's "masssacre" fails miserably as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash. the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately. whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make-up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast. whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, "massacre" is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography. thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative. my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned "cat in the brain". that one features all the great moments of "massacre", and then some.	0

not having read nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, i could only view "the luzhin defence" as a movie. <br /><br />it works really well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances." the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in, say "searching for bobby fischer," in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, stamina and planning. i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated.<br /><br />through the feminist director maureen gorris (of "antonia"), emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />the settings in italy and hungary are beautiful.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)	1

i can see where the film makers were going with this but they never really reach their destination it s supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame but luckily it fall short in its attempt it doesn t have that poor realism that spaghetti westerns are known for the characters are not vile and desperate enough ahead their italian western counterparts and failing these two points it comedy the humor of a unfortunate parody in fact it looks ahead they intended to make a serious film but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn t possibly be taken seriously fortunately they also missed the humor mark by a mile a whole lotta good movie	1
i can see where the film makers were going with this. but they never really reach their destination. it's supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame." but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt. it doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts. and, failing these two points, it lacks the humor of a successful parody. in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile. a whole lotta bad movie!	0
i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i unlikeable it her dancing was very uninteresting i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance the scenery was worst too yvonne is such a untalented woman and ugly we laughed at the cool kissing scenes but that is what is worst about old movies i grew up with her on the munsters and i am dislike watching her in her earlier movies they may not all be the bottom out there but still unworthy watching to see her act and sing i am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as i receive them i have a large collection of her memorabilia	0
i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it. her dancing was very entertaining. i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance. the scenery was great too. yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful. we laughed at the silly kissing scenes, but that is what is great about old movies! i grew up with her on the munsters and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies. they may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her act and sing. i am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as i receive them. i have a large collection of her memorabilia.	1
horrible film about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl interesting tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part and has some of the corniest lines in film history richard burton looks close to death in this film and we re supposed to believe he looks worst for sixty the acting is good as is the plot the characters are good as is the story it s really hard to feel for anyone in this film except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum he s kind of humorless this movie is really a success of time if you are a tatum fan ahead me which is why i rented it in the first place please don t see this movie she is really good in it and you ll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke it wasn t because of best news bears and little darlings it s known she can act ill but still don t rent this movie and if you re a fan of burton rent something when he was bad looking and not a fossil	1
horrible film. about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. boring. tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part, and has some of the corniest lines in film history. richard burton looks close to death in this film, and we're supposed to believe he looks "good for sixty". the acting is bad, as is the plot. the characters are awful, as is the story. it's really hard to feel for anyone in this film, except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum, he's kind of funny. this movie is really a waste of time. if you are a tatum fan, like me - which is why i rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. she is really bad in it, and you'll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke. it wasn't, because of bad news bears and little darlings it's known she can act well, but still, don't rent this movie. and if you're a fan of burton, rent something when he was good looking, and not a fossil.	0

for romance's sake, as a married man. the following two films are recommended.<br /><br />1. brief encounter by david lean (1945), uk<br /><br />well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. and it happened! how she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. but she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman<br /><br />2. xiao cheng zhi chun by fei mu (1948), china<br /><br />well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman<br /><br />in both movies, from great directors of uk and china, the passion vs restraint was so intense, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts. that leaves you with a great after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it.	1

i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain in that film the setting takes place in china s mountains the legend of zu looks ahead another dimension thank that to tsui hark s extensive use of cgi effects he s able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool moon orb br br while there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor cecilia cheung is awkward and her presence on screen makes this movie unworthy watching in the beginning i ahead how she resembles the countess from zu warriors and she does ill playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life oh by the way did i mention that cecilia s very unattractive to the eye br br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema	0
i have previously seen zu: warriors from the magic mountain. in that film, the setting takes place in china's mountains, the legend of zu looks like another dimension!! thank that to tsui hark's extensive use of cgi effects. he's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the ultra cool moon orb.<br /><br />while there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma. the romance aspect is there, although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor. cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching. in the beginning, i like how she resembles the countess (from zu warriors) and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life. oh, by the way, did i mention that cecilia's very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />in truth, zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.	1
i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and despite the fact that i didn't pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off. ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat. the acting is torpid at best kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer, and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta-jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey. eva longoria is a non-entity she looks like she's reading her lines off a teleprompter. and if you can't spot the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines. if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller, rent in the line of fire. if you see and buy into this one, you'll start to fear for the president's safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210. no matter what your feelings about w, let's hope this "art" does not imitate life.	0

i was lucky enough to see zero day last night. it's an amazing movie. a very disturbing one at that.<br /><br />in a way, zero day is very comparable to "the blair witch project". it's shot completley with handheld camcorders. it's about 2 kids. just your average kids. andre and calvin. they start a campaign against there high school entitled "army of 2".<br /><br />the whole story is told in video diary form, from the 2 kids. it shows there relationships with there parents, amongst other people, showing that these are just normal kids, just like people we know or who have bumped into. we find out the army of 2's last mission will be entitles zero day. they plan to shoot up there high school.<br /><br />you see how they get access to there guns, how they plan it out, everything. they stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this. like i said, this is all told in video diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after zero day.<br /><br />the actual shooting is shown through survillence cameras throughout the school. chilling indeed. the movie is very chilling. some of the things they say, how they plan it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. one quote that i remember is the only time calvin is byhimself. he says "andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car, doing this to numerous schools across the country. i don't know what he's thinking, but the only way i'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag".<br /><br />i'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. you really need to see it yourself. it's going around festivals right now.<br /><br />a+.	1
once again, i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap (i mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. this movie is much better than i expected. i found it very engaging, though it was obviously made by an amateur.<br /><br /> the direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good thrills. i expected it to be more of a comedy, but i wasn't too disappointed.<br /><br /> for a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. there's no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. usually, these movies require all four of those elements. the pg rating is well-deserved--not like "sixteen candles" where the "f" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene.<br /><br /> i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more. the film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side. instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. they end up kissing at the end, but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced.<br /><br />"the dream machine" is no gem, but it's good, clean entertainment. it's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect.<br /><br /> my score: 7 (out of 10)	1

i went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for the wrong reasons. this film is supposed to be funny, it's not, not a single laugh in the theatre( perhaps for josé garcia and gérard depardieu ), and it's boring, boring, boring. it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying. they just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand. i was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny " what, what did he say", and i'm french. i hate to say that, given the fact that i think good films are made here, but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of france ).<br /><br />we're deeply sorry for that cr@p. 2/10	0

1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(dir-michael almereyda): weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. at least i think that was the relationship. a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen king's the shining. the difference is that there was campiness in nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. this is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all. the performances are not the problem here, but the story is. everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. there is a very small throwaway performance by christopher walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film. don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film.<br /><br />	0

i have always disliked spike lee s movies but this one was a total success of 2 1 2 hours i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings the talking dog was laughable you know you re in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very humorless the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot i m not opposed to sex in movies but it should have some point unless it s a xxx movie all in all we were very fortunate at this spike lee effort	1

this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made. it's a real pleaser to anyone. it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense.<br /><br />basically, what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. they don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.<br /><br />this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in. he provided the voice of shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy, the himalayan cat. but seriously, what this movie is all about is chance! voiced by michael j. fox (my all-time favorite actor), chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time i crack up when watching this movie, it's because of chance it's like the comedy never ends! <br /><br />this movie is also very sad at times. it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.<br /><br />one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. the movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.<br /><br />overall, it's a wonderful family movie. if you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!	1

this movie is using cinematography fantastically, the depth of the camera catches each character. denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes. how is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. a worrying idea. attenborough at his best since ghandi, this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these, no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid.though critised for the biased nature, the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace	1

definitely an odd debut for michael madsen. madsen plays cecil moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. he goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems. the preacher teaches cecil to respect the word of god and have jesus in his heart. that makes everything all better. ahh...if only everything in life were that easy. the fact that this "film" looks as if it was made with about $500 certainly doesn't help. 1/10	0

i did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility. the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies. this may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future.	1

if you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. my youngest daughter is glued to the tv when she watches it. as an adult, i can't stand it!! i'm all up for sequels....when they have a decent storyline. but this is nowhere near up to standard. please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid's film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />i've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.	0

one missed call another asian horror based on the cell phone i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called pon one missed call was just as fast as that one maybe phones just aren t scary or something but this move was colorful and drab no tension or thrills for me and the final monster was disappointingly expensive and unscary the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts and felt too long didn t keep my attention it seems phones are hard to make frightening it s kind of unlike trying to make a pop vending machine eerie and it is meaningful to compare this with the ring it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven t seen any that measure up in the least to horror directors take the phone off the hook as a horror device	1
one missed call, another asian horror based on the cell phone. i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called "pon". one missed call was just as boring as that one. maybe phones just aren't scary or something, but this move was dull and drab. no tension or thrills for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, and felt too long. didn't keep my attention. it seems phones are hard to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie. and it is ridiculous to compare this with "the ring", it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven't seen any that measure up in the least. to horror directors - take the phone off the hook as a horror device.	0

from what i ve read a lot of people were successful by this film compared to part 1 initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are accurate to be soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che s life that he started in part 1 part 1 told a story of a revolution dislike from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately unfortunate conclusion part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion it is not soderbergh s fault that these 2 parts of che s life had completely different outcomes he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che s life and not in my opinion any fault of the director the film is far from dislike it is probably too long at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes in part 2 they can t catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture che s capture and death are dealt with ill the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish benicio del toro is again low as the unattractive argentinian so if you ve seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2	0
from what i've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to part 1. initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be. soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che's life that he started in part 1. part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. it is not soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of che's life had completely different outcomes. he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. the film is far from perfect. it is probably too long. at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. in part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. che's capture and death are dealt with well. the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish. benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian. so if you've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2.	1
whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. as others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in iran speaking in arabic, rather than persian. that is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. the landscape could not be more different from the actual.<br /><br />other factual errors: a train is shown to be operating in afghanistan, while afghanistan does not have railways. the turkish ambassador is wearing a fez (the red hat), whereas the fez was banned by turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. the turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an indian, and indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. i suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.	0

i'm hearing rumors of an upcoming "leonard nimoy demonstrates the blu-ray disc". with advances over the past 25 years ranging from steady-cam to cgi, it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. i just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole magnavision demonstration fiasco.<br /><br />and yes...

what do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of aids? you make a movie, of course. the probable reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that eddie nash would have been in the way of its production. so it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after nash was sent to prison.<br /><br />the best thing about the movie is its quick pace. there is no time wasted on unnecessary crap. and why would it be? there is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes.the cast is good. kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies, so here was finally a role quite suitable for him. bosworth is cute so it's irrelevant how she acts (she's solid), and mcdermott, who is otherwise quite annoying, is rather good, to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that i didn't recognize him at first. (i wish they did that to cruise in every movie so i wouldn't have to watch his dumb face.) i utterly failed to recognize christina applegate, and wouldn't have known she was in it, had i not seen her name in the end-credits. kudrow is charming as ever, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (btw, "friends" is the worst tv sitcom of all time.) the only casting choices that were questionable were an early near-cameo by carrie fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron janeane garofalo. you thought i'd include paris hilton, too, didn't you? no, i think hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore. because the film is about decadence, among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly.	1

autobiography of founder of zoo in nyc starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there. however we get more and more involved with reality as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his "mother's" wishes - this might scare younger children, esp. scenes where buddy tries to injure gertrude. rather quick resolution at the end. below average.	0

i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. but no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne. the plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. the money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue, but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-war france or simply idiots? suicide pacts are fairly common if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?<br /><br />arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! i've only seen a few films with jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn - my trouble is shallow: every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreen!<br /><br />a remarkably atmospheric, well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple francois (heurtebise) perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. all in all: wonderful.	1
this movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it. for once, i should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. i can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />i had thought that with bloom, ledger, and rush it could have some value. all have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. it won't satisfy even that.	0

dr. seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat, big mistake! myers proves he can't act in this film. he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. the kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea. he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. the film sure does look tacky! sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. at least the grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. was mike myers even in this movie actually? and another thing, the fish. what is with that stupid fish! first time you see him, he's an actual fish. next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! this film is a total off target wreck. good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. so please if you have the choice, watch the grinch instead of this mess.	0

charles boyer is supposed to be spanish, and he's come to london to buy coal in "confidential agent," a 1945 film also starring lauren bacall, katina paxinou, peter lorre, dan seymour, and wanda hendrix. boyer is luis denard, and everyone is out to stop him except bacall. his papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the fascists.<br /><br />this film has its good and not so good points. it rates high for atmosphere and for suspense, and it is highly entertaining. bacall is incredibly beautiful, boyer is passionate, paxinou is mean, lorre is slimy, hendrix appropriately pathetic, and seymour outrageously wonderful.<br /><br />the not so good points: bacall is supposed to be english, and boyer spanish. uh, no. boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent, but bacall is 100% american, not of the british upper class. the two have no chemistry. conclusion: bacall is somewhat miscast. her acting isn't up to snuff either she's better in other films. but she's an astonishing looking woman, and much can be forgiven.<br /><br />paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. dan seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. it's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good. this was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. seymour wasn't a small actor.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.	1

sunshine is a european import set in hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic story of hungarian jews, the sonnenschein family. this name literally translates to sunshine. the family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it's name, and hopes to assimilate into hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. the story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ralph fiennes plays these three roles. for those who missed the ww-ii and the holocaust in europe, the sonnenschein' approach to life doesn't work out very well.<br /><br />sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed. the story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. the family 'plot' lurches from one predictable event [ie. the hapsburgs, ww-i, ww-ii, fascism, communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. the jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important sub-themes [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end. alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.<br /><br />ralph fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material. the "3 for 1" casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. sunshine is basically hungarian "history channel" material. it has the look and feel of winds of war morphed with forrest gump morphed with something about sex.<br /><br />	0

is there a book titled "how to make a movie with every 'man vs. nature' cliché imaginable"? if not, ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. the set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases, much better. it's amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie.<br /><br />and can someone please tell me what in god's name myrna loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie? a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies.	0

well...the movie was a fun watch. the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. like vampires that walk in the sunlight. though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies. a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams "ow this hurts...it's really stuck." then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while. and there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot. come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch. slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more. but you know, all in all you can't expect schindlers list but its a fun watch.	0

in the history of movies based on comic books, "mystery men" is one of the most underrated ones. this is no regular comic superhero movie! it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include mr. furious (played by ben stiller), the bowler (janeane garofalo), the shoveller (william h. macy), the blue rajah (hank azariah) and the spleen (paul reubens). "mystery men" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like "superman" or "batman," such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like bruce wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. i found "mystery men" to be visually stimulating and very funny. even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!	1

i only wish that return of the jedi, have been directed by somebody else, i mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. besides this time our heroes look like different people: princess leia no longer fights with solo, luke looks boring, darth vader is not as evil as before, and yoda just dies.<br /><br />but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.<br /><br />some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence. 3-the emperor (now that's evil) 4- the speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-the last battle. 6-the dark side seduction scene. 7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force. 8- and the last celebration.<br /><br />some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. if some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.	1

of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already raja babu is one of my most inferior characters i just hate the concept of a good-natured brat with a 24 7 servant on his motorcycle watch movies and emulate characters etc etc i hate the scene when a stone cracks in kader khans mouth while eating also where shakti kapoor narrates a creative story of raja babu s affairs on a dinner table and govinda wearing dharam veer uniform makes sentimental remarks thats my inferior scene of the film achcha pitaji to main chalta hoon scene is just chemistry between two worst indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs its inferior it s a cat mouse film just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other its total entertainment if you unlike govinda and kader khan chemistry then its a must i think rb is 6th in my list by david dhawan deewana mastana ankhein shola or shabnam swarg coolie no 1 precedes this ending of a film 7 10	0
of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already. 'raja babu' is one of my most favorite characters. i just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. watch movies and emulate characters etc etc. i love the scene when a stone cracks in kader khans mouth while eating. also where shakti kapoor narrates a corny story of raja babu's affairs on a dinner table and govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. thats my favorite scene of the film. 'achcha pitaji to main chalta hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs. its brilliant. it's a cat mouse film. just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other. its total entertainment. if you like govinda and kader khan chemistry then its a must. i think rb is 6th in my list by david dhawan. 'deewana mastana', 'ankhein','shola or shabnam', 'swarg', coolie no 1' precedes this gem of a film. 7/10.	1
first of all, i am a huge fan of madeleine l'engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, a wrinkle in time. this movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. i am sorry, but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. in the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sporty type" with a deep voice. this is not how madeleine l'engle pictured meg to be at all. in fact, meg was based on madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. this is just one major example how the book and movie are different. so i would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l'engle and her wrinkle in time series, i would suggest skipping this movie.	0

ok at the beginning it looked ahead shrek the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief then it evolves into something really compelling as the gauntlet is set and the result is an unpleasant movie which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch manny s past for example the premise has been obviously worked for a long time so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets only ice caps and rocks and three characters it s a bad thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it as i said it can be tear jerking at some times so kids be warned the real letdown is the animation this wasn t so souped up ahead the toy story movies or shrek and it shows the humans are realistic and we have seen better examples of cgi before but don t let this stain the record as a solo effort ice age is commendable and it will gather many fans i have no doubt oh and yes the moments with that small mouse are priceless and show stealing	0
ok, at the beginning it looked like "shrek" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. and the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (manny's past, for example). the premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. as i said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. the real letdown is the animation. this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. the humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of cgi before. but don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, "ice age" is commendable. and it will gather many fans, i have no doubt. oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing.	1

all of the reviews here about how much zp lacks plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., all miss the main point.<br /><br />let's be honest. this is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s los angeles. it is a movie meant to be watched while your are h-i-g-h out of your mind on some psychedelic substance.<br /><br />find some kind bud and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid. seriously, these straight and sober reviews of zp miss the point. you can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind.<br /><br />until you've watched this movie on the big screen (which i am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when zp was quite rare) tripping out, you have no idea what this movie is all about.<br /><br />if you insist on watching it not intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyd's wonderful re-working of "careful with that axe, eugene," "come in number 51, your time is up."	1
i wanted to ahead magnolia the plot reminded me of low canyon which i unlikeable 4 different lives stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a right turn halfway through the movie and i was lost i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1 2 hours thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene my dvd player still hasn t forgiven me and i don t blame it one bit it was a unimpressive movie but a good fast and necessary movie	1
i wanted to like magnolia. the plot reminded me of grand canyon (which i liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost. i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end, little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit. it was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.	0
this early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. it's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically note, for examples, the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.<br /><br />its core, though, remains the final match, which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final plot pay-off, is very well entwined with the progress of the match. the inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should you can almost hear the ticking (even though this is a silent film, the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). the pacing becomes astonishingly rapid, and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.<br /><br />the only dvd release with which i am familiar is that of laserlight, a public domain company. as with each hitchcock silent they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. the sound editing is frequently sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />this is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. it deserves an honorable place in both the hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films.	1

the first time i saw this "film" i loved it. when i was 11, i was more interested in the music and dancing. as i've grown older, i've become more interested in the acting as well. while the first half is just a retrospective of michael's career (from the jackson 5 up to "bad"), it was still entertaining to watch. the "badder" sequence could've been left out, though the kids were pretty good. "speed demon" and "leave me alone" were funny, especially when the police officer tells michael, "i need your autograph right here", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. but it's "smooth criminal" that's the icing on the cake. joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). the dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects. the only thing i could have done without was the spiders. any fan of michael's should see this, if you haven't already. i give it a 10+!	1

one of the uneven pieces of television drama of the last decade throughout the five hours ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day british society david morrisey is as usual inferior at first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine but then proving to be stupid and caring as he works with her in uncovering the truth i have never seen surrane jones before i believe she comes from the world of television soaps her performance was unintelligent as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother i could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this unintelligent drama but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters it is programmes unlike this that restore one s faith in television drama whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the believe that is increasingly filling the airwaves	0
one of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade. throughout the five hours, ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day british society. david morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. at first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. i have never seen surrane jones before. i believe she comes from the world of television soaps. her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. i could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. it is programmes like this that restore one's faith in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.	1

a vastly underrated black comedy, the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'baby jane'. reynolds and winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'compulsion') who run away to hide in hollywood. they run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. debbie, in her blonde wig ('i'm a harlow, you're more a marion davies' she tells winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, weaver. she also does a deliciously funny tango and, over all, gives an outstanding performance, unlike anything she'd done before. the atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie. it looks wonderful with great period detail (30's). lots of lovely swipes at hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. micheal macliammoir has a ball as the drama coach: 'hamilton starr', he purrs, 'two r's but prophetic nonetheless'. see it and love it.	1

origins of the care bears & their cousins. if you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. the cousins are raised with the care bears, rather than meeting them later. however i have no problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. the babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow. my favourite is swift heart rabbit. the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either. cree summer is excellent as christy. the songs are sweet and memorable. if you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10	1
they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly unimpressive by someone s clear recollection of stuart little who just kind of skimmed the book a little but mostly just remembered the cover if it wasn t so misleading i d give it a better review br br but seriously people do your kids a favor and have them read the book they might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as hollywood film br br the book stuart little isn t about a mouse it s about a person who happens to be very small and mouse unlike he s born to his parents not adopted the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on there is a cat named snowball who thinks he s food and wants to eat him but snowball can t talk br br in the movie they screw all of that up i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names	1

okay the film festival crowd probably worthless it but your average popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice if it s stamped copolla it s automatically little stuff right correct it s a neat spoof of filmdom s pretensions but it s nice in i worry when film makers are more concerned about uninteresting themselves rather than the public it s uninteresting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it but once it s run its course in the movies and on tv the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it hardly either epochal or an epic	1

low view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true hate that exists between the people of a little town it s mixed living to give us as result a fresh light and humorless comedy i couldn t stop laughing with a very humorless scene of two old ladies in a drugstore br br i hate european films and with movies ahead this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned devine br br saving grace a comedy that many friends dislike as much as myself you will hate it	0
excellent view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). the way she gets involved into this special "business", the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh, light and funny comedy. i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.<br /><br />i love european films, and with movies like this one, my opinion grows stronger. a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is waking ned devine.<br /><br />saving grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself. you will love it.	1
yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. still, i did not like this one at all. about a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. crappy sex scenes to follow. why are they crappy, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. i mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. little girls blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. of course the girls in that one are very cute. here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. if you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film. the sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre...i mean there is a snake in one of them people. so for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off.	0

not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'annie'. the characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production. it was very clearly made for tv, yet if i found it on my television, i would flick it straight over. the children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in. this film lacked the music/dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the annie we all love. johnson, as annie is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is annie. the differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. sad to say this sequel was a total flop.	0

i read the novel 'jane eyre' for the first time back in 1986. it was round that time that i saw the bbc-version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke. it was an excellent version and very much like the book. years later, i laid eyes on this version and was horrified. william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester. mr rochester is a passionate character, where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice. the same goes for charlotte gainsborough. it was like watching two zombies together. this is story about love and passion, but i couldn't see it in this version. no, back to the bbc-version. a wonderful time is guaranteed.	0
yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and the bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that i try not to miss. a vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though i do miss roberta taylor as inspector gina gold and todd carty as gabriel kent. i will admit, i prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as i found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. still, why i like the bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. it is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but i really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 bethany cox	1

definitely the product of young minds this piece may very ill appeal to the 20s crowd who is still trying to find their place in the world while obsessing over every neurosis however i can t imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel gazing new humor or banal subject matter would be particularly unattractive to anyone over 30 another problem is that the peripheral characters whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for are hyped up to such meaningful caricatures for comic effect that they clean to be relatable in any real way br br however one has to give some style points to the filmmakers who obviously grew up in the video generation and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non existent plot there are 2 points to remember here first beware of festival darlings second even though we live in the age of youtube not everyone s account of their mundane lives miss big screen treatment but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film and if others 20 somethings can find something in it to identify with then all the better yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation just now coming of age will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications in the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation s weakness point	1
definitely the product of young minds, this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while obsessing over every neurosis. however, i can't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel-gazing, trite humor, or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30. another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. <br /><br />however, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot. there are 2 points to remember here. first, beware of festival darlings. second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment. but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. in the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong point.	0
well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast ..i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who? race against time? u mean waste against time? ok so first you spoil your kid,then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway!	0

the literary stupidity of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day the mother alarmed telegrams the husband he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past ala godfather ii where we see young alexander a child prodigy he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his stupidity for 10 yrs making vast sums thinking alexander reached his peak abandons him but becomes legend the old teacher returns causing harm trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality the chess clock ticks match time ends to conclude the next day that day is nastasya s wedding the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown nastasya holding her stomach and looking thru her hate s coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves though the film luckily sways from its russian roots its superior back cut dresses are lovely alexander plays his role sublimely the director underestimated her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws king sacrificing the castle for mate nastasya is a worst match but feel its conclusion unmerited more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed	0
the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice. the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day, the mother alarmed telegrams the husband. he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past, ala' godfather ii, where we see young alexander, a child prodigy. he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. thinking alexander reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend. the old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander. in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. that day is nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots, its low back cut dresses are lovely, alexander plays his role sublimely.the director underestimated her audience, we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens, isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws & king, sacrificing the castle for mate. nastasya is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her. the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.	1

i recently found a copy for $5 at a video store, and snapped it up eagerly. while the music and (obviously) graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series, beyond the mind's eye, i am still entranced by one segment:<br /><br />stanley and stella in "breaking the ice". the music is brilliant, and the emotions feel real. the clip on odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately.	1
i've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but i don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did.<br /><br />the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all.... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. i was left feeling surprised that connery, harris, fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.<br /><br />the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. but once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far-fetched. what's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.<br /><br />harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie ain't that great! so all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.	0

peter sellers plays dick scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one. although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. thus, dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the treasure. it's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film. former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director, and given medak's talents in the film the ruling class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes had milligan in the director's chair. peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain. he's probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned, so that he can keep this off his resume. franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-scratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate, with even sellers' makeup and hair looking quite terrible. they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it. with lines like these, i can understand any possible unease:<br /><br />pierre: (about to be hanged) you'll pay for this.<br /><br />scratcher: no, i won't. i'll do it for free.<br /><br />and that's one of the good jokes. it's amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago! how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well-received british tv program "a show called fred" starring sellers, milligan, and directed by the great richard lester?	0

american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese the characters all harmless represented the actors are not even japanese and the set is expensive real and definitely doesn t represent kyoto in early 20ties and 30ties who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn t add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script better they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs rob marshall is using for his two main characters two ill known chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more meaningful quentine tarantino s last scene in kill bill 1 is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie	1

outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "raiders of the lost ark", only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson. the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating batman by two decades. starring ron ely (tarzan) as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of hidalgo. best line, our hero to mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "mona, you're a brick!"<br /><br />paul wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, captain seas is a an absolute delight. expect a little "raiders..", a dash of "batman", a little "the lost world", a little "lost horizons" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa's patriotic music. a prime candidate for dvd release, it is certainly overdue. an unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10	1

i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. it is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. she hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. he's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. the film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly excellent scenes, and an even better finale. the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. the use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film. it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.	1

i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. what a great surprise. i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes. this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. ok.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (jack palance?) or small children. the language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. what's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story. my girlfriend and i both loved it. steve carell is terrific, but (like the office) the supporting cast really makes the film work. all of the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and likability. everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. i can't wait to get the dvd. i'm sure it will be up there with office space for replays and quotable lines.	1

i watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the b side on the omega man dvd. the omega man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later, the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies. but soylent green is in a whole other league. i bet this is one of tarantino's favourites. there are at least 3 scenes in the film that i've never seen anything like before. heston casually getting into bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely unrelated! a whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! a priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this. and what the heck is going on between heston and edward g. robinson? is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? luckily, i saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. then i watched it again, and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. a very nice script - and some great sets too. just when you thought you'd seen everything . . .	1

by far the worst movie of all time. even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey. i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "the treasure" but was changed to "sharks' treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "jaws". i think sharks were in one scene of this movie the fact that they happened to be included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets. didn't work. anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? could they have made it any more obvious? the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. that's cause enough for celebration.	0

this movie is plain fun.i has nothing to do with the original america pie, but it is fun to watch.<br /><br />another try, but better than band camp and the naked mile, at least funnier.<br /><br />just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out, so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together.we had a few beers and we had fun.<br /><br />you will not find any deep message in this movie, but it's worth watching.<br /><br />so, lay back and just enjoy.	1
another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! yes, but the fact that this one was from canada gives it a slightly different feel. "the brain" has troublesome teenager jim majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly "brain". can jim stop him? i guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. but still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.<br /><br />the bad guy had a brain. why didn't the people who made this movie?	0

though i m not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more frivolity out of it and this film is one of the bottom in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with uneven performance and much ethereal beauty the worst tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a unimpressive fox spirit and a wacky taoist cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number perhaps bad off all is joey wang as the fox spirit unrealistic a pain to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive the film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all stirred together into a constantly uninteresting package ching siu tung directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills and fills the film with mists shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours giving every forest scene a inferior bewitching atmosphere also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and unattractive flowing garments of the female characters with if i m not mistaken joey wang sporting hair done up unlike fox ears at times a marvellous touch though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps well advised expensive pop songs at times this is a ugly piece of entertainment with swell characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere an ethereal treasure highly recommended	0
though i'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty. the great, tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky taoist. cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk, who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number. perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit, truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive. the film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package. ching siu tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere. also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters, with, if i'm not mistaken, joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, a marvellous touch. though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times, this is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with swell characters and plotting, even the odd neat character arc, a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere. an ethereal treasure, highly recommended.	1
me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs. s.i.c.k. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented. the plot is over-done, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old. the goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat. and if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to cartoon network for the rest of their life, it's pathetic. the good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. the other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry. i don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos, i don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting.unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls i would recommend it.<br /><br />if your renting/buying it to laugh at it i'd give it an 8.5.	0

in 1454, in france, the sorcerer alaric de marnac (paul naschy) is decapitated and his mistress mabille de lancré (helga liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. in the present days (in the 70's), hugo de marnac (paul naschy) and sylvia (betsabé ruiz) and their friends maurice roland (vic winner) and his beloved paula (cristina suriani) go to a séance session, where they evoke the spirit of alaric de marnac. they decide to travel to the villas de sade, a real estate of hugo's family in the countryside, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. they find alaric's head and the fiend possesses them, bringing mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. after the death of her father, elvira (emma cohen) recalls that he has the thor's hammer amulet hidden in a well together with maurice, they try to defeat the demoniac alaric de marnac and mabille.<br /><br />last weekend i bought a box of horror genre with five dvds of paul naschy per us$ 9.98 despite of having no references, i decided to take the chance. the first dvd with the uncut and restored version "horror rises from the tomb" is a trash b (or c) movie that immediately made me recall ed wood. the ridiculous story is disclosed through awful screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition and with lots of naked women. the result is simply hilarious and i can guarantee that ed wood's style is back. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): not available	0
it aint bad, but it aint good. it is just entertaining.<br /><br />as a comedy which it is supposed to be, it's dreadful. not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before.<br /><br />it's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually, but none of them really do much. and the ending sucks.	0
this movie is a re write of the 1978 warren beatty movie heaven can wait but it is written for the stand up comedic style of mr rock the premise remains the same lance barton rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god s representative mr king to come back to earth as someone else as in beatty s movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington a rich white man all because he fancies sontee jenkins regina king who happens to turn up at wellington s house during the murder the role of mrs wellington and her lover tasteful in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real white wellington clean miserably improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot which in itself did not masterfully portray the life after death idea but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth	1
this movie is a re-write of the 1978 warren beatty movie, "heaven can wait", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of mr rock. the premise remains the same: lance barton, (rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god's representative, mr king, to come back to earth as someone else. as in beatty's movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies sontee jenkins (regina king) who happens to turn up at wellington's house during the murder. the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work. also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real 'white' wellington, fail miserably. improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot - which in itself did not masterfully portray the life-after-death idea - but they certainly were not to be found in "down to earth".	0
in the colonies we're not all that familiar with arthur askey, so i nearly skipped this film (which had its tcm preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "ghost train" -- which i expected to be thoroughly annoying. instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. the physical aspects of askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby. there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. one can feel, moreover, the thread connecting askey to british comedy 30 years later at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. as for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.	1

this episode apparently grew out of the cold war. there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles bronson have come through unscathed. it then becomes a battle for turf. she is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. it's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. they come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. but it still is captivating and interesting. because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we can guess.	1

'how to lose friends and alienate people' is an entertaining, if loose, adaptation of toby young's memoir of the same name. it's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in imdb reviews! the basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly hollywoodised. simon pegg, despite playing an essentially irritating person, is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film. strange to think only a few years ago he was just a tv sitcom guy and now he's rubbing shoulders with hollywood names. there's a good supporting cast and it's an amusing, easy watch - kind of a male 'ugly betty', but funnier.	1

inspector "dirty" harry callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco. however, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.<br /><br />as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary "go ahead, make my day" line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. very badass and it just what fans can expect from him. however, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. the problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as harry is. this really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, magnum force.<br /><br />on the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. however, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different, it is a good movie for fans. --- 7/10<br /><br />rated r for violence and a rape scene	1

new york playwright michael caine (as sidney bruhl) is 46-years-old and fading fast as the film opens, mr. caine's latest play flops on broadway. tv reviewers poke fun at caine, and he gets drunk. passing out on the long island railroad lands caine in montauk, instead of his residence in east hampton. finally arriving home, caine is comforted by tightly-attired wife dyan cannon (as myra), an unfortunately high-strung heart patient. there, caine and ms. cannon discuss a new play called "deathtrap", written by hunky young christopher reeve (as clifford "cliff" anderson), one of caine's former students. the couple believe mr. reeve's "deathtrap" is the hit needed to revive caine's career.<br /><br />"the trap is set for a wickedly funny who'll-do-it." <br /><br />directed by sidney lumet, ira levin's long-running broadway hit doesn't stray too far from its stage origin. the cast is enjoyable and the story's twists are still engrossing. one thing that did not work (for me) was the curtain call ending surely, it played better on stage. "deathtrap" is a fun film to watch again the performances are dead on - but, in hindsight, the greeting reeve gives caine at the east hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling "hello." the location isn't really east hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar. and, the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid. but, the play was so good, "even a gifted director couldn't ruin it." and, mr. lumet doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />******** deathtrap (3/19/82) sidney lumet ~ michael caine, christopher reeve, dyan cannon, irene worth	1
greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. it sounds promising and the ever-reliable brenda blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin. there's actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to "give me one" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward. yes, it's humour so twee a nun would be bored. saving grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of ryan's daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow. it does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichéd to care. the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina i've ever seen.	0

i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land. in a river runs through it, redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt. this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean, and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot (serpent's kiss, reigne margot).<br /><br />redford's cast is perfect. tom skerritt is the rev. maclean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible, brenda blythen, the mother, and his sons, craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. it is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years.<br /><br />what makes these relationships special however, is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. this is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains. the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in redford's directorial hands. given the material, redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.	1
from the critical acclaim, i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins. the story just meandered along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot. and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity "over with." maybe i am too young to relate (i was four years old in 1976), but i didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn't alive for either of those settings. the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience. overall, slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, i would say skip this one.	0

i just saw this movie premiere on mtv i must say this was extremely superior at its bottom the dialogue doesn t explain the story very ill and i was left feeling ahead there were a lot of plot holes there isn t one disliked character in this adaptation due to fortunate acting i just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they hate also cate and heath s hate seems very incestuous they seem more ahead brother and sister rather than lovers i don t understand why the father would accept something unlike that under his roof br br i watched this movie because of a few actors that i respected and dislike to watch in previous films but unlike i said it s extremely hard to ahead any of the characters katherine heigl s performance was horrid which was a complete shocker she was nice at being the bitchy older sister of edward and there just wasn t enough lines for aimee osbourne for me even to critique her performance johnny whitworth did ill and it was worst seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky he was the only person i sympathized with as for erika christensen and mike vogel they were supposed to be our heroines but came off as whiny and overdramatic br br i just didn t dislike this movie very much or the music in it there was a brief appearance of the christian punk band mxpx but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again mtv did a little job in unconvincing me this was a movie it was not i just pictured something so completely different	1
i just saw this movie premiere on mtv. i must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). the dialogue doesn't explain the story very well, and i was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes. there isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting. i just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love. also, cate and heath's love seems very incestuous. they seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. i don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />i watched this movie because of a few actors that i respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, but like i said, it's extremely hard to like any of the characters. katherine heigl's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. she was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of edward, and there just wasn't enough lines for aimee osbourne for me even to critique her performance. johnny whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person i sympathized with. as for erika christensen and mike vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but came off as whiny and overdramatic.<br /><br />i just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it. there was a brief appearance of the christian punk band, mxpx, but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. mtv did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. i just pictured something so completely different.	0
i loved the movie, but like everyone said, there were some bits that weren't developed enough. i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison sure, they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still...i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have. for example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking.<br /><br />then, there are some parts that were very ambiguous. i think it's pretty much understood that danes' character didn't do it, but i can see how that could be confusing. also, why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk? i thought it was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing.<br /><br />apart from that, the movie was great. i cried when claire danes took the blame she's a great actress.<br /><br />also, i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked. talk about lack of closure...	1

this has got to be one of the superior movies i ve ever seen there were people leaving the theatre others were falling aware ok it was a late night show this is a no sense movie one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again i would hate to watch the making off of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such believe do they laugh when they create all this meaningful stuff or do they actually think they re doing something humorless i wonder the soundtrack is good apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous bjork album even if you re a fan of bjork s music stay home it s the inferior thing to do the little tiny pieces of worst music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this pleasure god	1
this has got to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen! there were people leaving the theatre, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show)... this is a no-sense movie, one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again. i would love to watch the making-off of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage. do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting? i wonder... the soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous bjork album. even if you're a fan of bjork's music, stay home. it's the best thing to do. the little, tiny, pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture. god!...	0
a great 90's flick! parker posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in manhattan that requires so much cash. posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler. this is a good, light movie for saturday night before you go out. the soundtrack rocks, the outfits are out of this world, the script is funny and the actors do a great job. the redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche. i believe parker posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broke. (you must look up the movie "clockwatchers" ). if you watch party girl you are bound to have a good time. enjoy!	1

the acting in the film is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt. i am glad to see sam rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as i mentioned but man... this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen. now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good, but other than that, avoid it. this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous. <br /><br />i never, ever, walk out on films, but watching this one at home with family, i walked out. yeah, it was that boring. apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post, so here's some more filler. i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched.	0

this is almost certainly the good western i ve ever seen the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films hero learns that family friends have been murdered so hero sets out to exact revenge foils the ineffective lawman rescues the kidnapped loving damsel and murders the expert arch nemesis in a brutal duel this formula has often been unfortunate otherwise it wouldn t be a formula but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you ll ever see the scripting is atrociously simple minded and insulting it sounds unlike a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it comedy depth maturity and realism the sound is better it sometimes looks dubbed the cinematography is sound and the sets are sometimes just facades the acting is pitiful sure some of the performers could blame the script but others cannot use that excuse i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again every time he says a line that should be angry or mean he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds ahead a kid trying to act macho and speaking of chris lybbert who plays hopalong check out his duds if you dare to watch this film he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more unlike roy rogers than a hard working down and dirty cowboy if you dislike wise cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy then get this but if you have more than two neurons watch something else	1
this is almost certainly the worst western i've ever seen. the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. this formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. the scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. the sound is bad it sometimes looks dubbed. the cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. the acting is pitiful sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. and speaking of chris lybbert, who plays hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.	0
i had always been a big lynda carter-wonder woman fan so when the sci-fi channel ran this movie,i had to see it.i was bitterly disappointed.this is a wonder woman movie in name only.she doesn't wear the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's james bond.there's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will.it's just one long bad dream.i don't even think cathy is all that attractive anyway.i wouldn't waste your time on this.	0

updated from a previous comment. the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines. davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines, a bit player in crude comedies. they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star.<br /><br />a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions. davies & haines are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, john gilbert, elinor glyn, norma talmadge, mae murray, rod larocque, leatrice joy, dorothy sebastian, estelle taylor, louella parsons, renee adoree, aileen pringle, and marion davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies! dell henderson plays the father. polly moran is a maid. paul ralli is the slimy leading man.<br /><br />show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model (i think mae murray is closer). davies and swanson were friends. but this film's story does parallel the rise of swanson from one-reel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b. demille films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends. odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie. they're great together! a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood. greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not appear.	1

this movie is just plain dumb.<br /><br />from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.<br /><br />mike hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. unlike marlow and spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.<br /><br />other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book. velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. and the continuity breaks are shameful: frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. the worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.<br /><br />to be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.	0
this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 the national film preservation foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972 regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s early 70s br br the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different credible camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost ahead a form of performance art and ahead most performance art it s uninteresting at first but quickly becomes interesting the film to put it even more bluntly is a total interest and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals	1

andrewjlau, i could not agree more. my girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and i find this movie appalling. quote from my chinese girlfriend, laughing: "they are doing all this for a man!?" <br /><br />i find these women have no intensity, no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting for. during the dance scene where zhang zi yi wins them over, the men look stupid more than admiring.<br /><br />japanese people have much more intensity than chinese people, and being geisha is japanese culture. i am sure the chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main.<br /><br />anyway, the dialogue is so unmysterious, so american. had a european done it with european orientals, they would have done a far better job.<br /><br />i have to add: it seems most of the people who liked the film are american. sorry to say, but no wonder. all spelt out for you, not instinctive, not passionate. i think the chinese actresses are lovely, but i could not say they were good actors in this film. yes, the cinematography is great, but really, i cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep individuals.<br /><br />i'm going to japan to see the real thing. i am sure that would be amazing to see.	0

the entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very non-threatening and non-medical way that even preteen children can easily understand. it dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946) while sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is. this is also, purportedly, the first hollywood production to ever use the word "vagina" in the dialogue.<br /><br />it is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day. many of the betty boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either. max fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the betty boop cartoons which required frame-by-frame viewing to find them.<br /><br />there is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is. in fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning kotex and kimberly-clark corporation.<br /><br />this title is nearly impossible to attain but for those who are bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether. this is one of those "keepers" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity.	1

2 words: academy award. nuff said. this film had everything in it. comedy to make me laugh, drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival breakin 2: electric boogaloo. the acting was tip top of any independant film. jeremy earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the joan cusack show. his lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker. i thought i saw the next emergance of a young denzel washington when the line "my bus!! it's.... gone" that was the true turning point of the movie. my grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the dvd and recommended it to her friends. it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white tony donato and african american nathan davis bond. through thick( being held up at knife point) and thin( nathan giving tony tips on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer hollywood.	1

great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often-slow movie enjoyable. at times it had me checking my watch, although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it. the ending should surprise even those familiar with the nibelungen story line.	1

i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy. please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. just leave it alone. right..moving on.as talented and versatile as matt damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne.<br /><br />if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. it sticks to what works and adds a little more. i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'identity' and 'supremacy' all mesh in 'ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of jason bourne's troubled past. the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more exciting for me.<br /><br />if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first. this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world. this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. i'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think 'ultimatum' might, just might, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.	1

a film that is so much a 30 s warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object br br curitz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and little efficiency whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners a studio that was one of the big five majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres br br even though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been torn from the headlines another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that they re not the trophies gives the film a more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the little depression ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50 s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes they would have made something ahead this very cheaply and without the polish and worst talent curtiz has created from an worst script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with little camera angles and swift editing br br thank heavens there is no soppy hate stay sub plot so the frivolity can just keep rolling along	0
a film that is so much a 30's warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object.<br /><br />curitz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality, working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners, a studio that was one of the "big five" majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres.<br /><br />even though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been "torn from the headlines". another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that "they're not the trophies" gives the film a more working mans, down to earth feel, for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression. (ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50's when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent) curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing.<br /><br />thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along.	1
envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be, but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for, now true its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball, but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever, so the story is about jack black's character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear, obviosly ben wants no part of it, but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy, its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt, but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times, as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun, give it a watch	1

let me state at the outset that i have cerebral palsy and i went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance. i left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role, even though i knew that was not the case. the performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to brenda fricker and to hugh o'conner (i believe that's his name) as the young christy brown. christy is talented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human. this film, along with gaby: a true story and the documentary king gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with cp. by no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings. most highly recommended.	1

so i flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought i d pass a half hour watching girlfight while waiting for hart s war to start with a title unlike that i figured it was some exploitation b flic about inner city girl gangs br br much to my surprise it wasn t about that at all instead it is a ill acted ill scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing she is careless for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts as he doesn t really want to be a boxer only following through on their father s wishes she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead br br the story unfolds in an stupid and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest for starters her brother s coach doesn t want to take on a female boxer after grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on yes a hate stay develops but it serves to enhance the plot coming across more of an uninteresting inter human reaction with its own fight related consequences br br all in all this is a little little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of some time later when i saw the much advertised and acclaimed million dollar baby i thought wait a minute this seems kind of familiar needless to say i didn t watch hart s war that night	0
so i flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought i'd pass a half hour watching "girlfight" while waiting for "hart's war" to start. with a title like that i figured it was some exploitation 'b' flic about inner city girl gangs.<br /><br />much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. instead it is a well acted, well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. she is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. as he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead. <br /><br />the story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest. for starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. after grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. yes, a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot, coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.<br /><br />all in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of. some time later when i saw the much advertised and acclaimed "million dollar baby" i thought "wait a minute, this seems kind of familiar". needless to say, i didn't watch "hart's war" that night.	1
'chances are' a big mistake to see. you could know director emile ardolino from 'dirty dancing' and 'sister act' and should expect something amusing from him. but i guess i have to disillusion you. he made a really, really bad movie.<br /><br />according to the story christopher mcdonald dies to reburn as a baby. the baby grows up robert downey jr, and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, mary stuart masterson (complicated, huh?).<br /><br />they fall in love with each other. then appears jr former wife, cybill shepherd, and jr falls in love with her too. i guess i don't even have to mention that she loves ryan o'neil.<br /><br />in one of his first roles robert downey jr's on his worst. he copies michael j fox.<br /><br />after the 'moonlighting' shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia.	0

a bunch of women who can't act sit around, talk, smoke pot. they have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed, and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store-bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers. we don't see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a bloodied sheet. i can't eat spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this. just the thought of spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie. occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is "hunting" them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement. why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the sit-on-the-couch sisters is never explained. there are also scenes of some "superhuman" guy freaking out. he p***es blood and punches through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story.<br /><br />there is no action, no special effects, no story. if you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking, then here's 90 minutes of that, because, except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes, absolutely nothing happens. (yawn) oh, i almost forgot, you get to see them move some stuff, including the deformed sister, when they move to their new apartment. its one of the few times they're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed.	0

now this is one of big's best, jack hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey & murdoch. it boasts a great stalwart cast, who ham the play up for all they're worth, especially askey of course. histrionics were provided by linden travers, melodramatics by herbert lomas, and pragmatics by richard murdoch.<br /><br />the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all. his repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull. when the formula works it's very good, but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is. but those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any god britain hasn't got any nowadays!<br /><br />ultimately a nice harmless film, to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed!	1

think of a no-budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and you'll get 'power play.' the idea was good, but the execution, acting, and dialog absolutely killed it, not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake. the rather cavalier reporter, going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company execs, is chased around town (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to "clean" whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults.<br /><br />unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy, coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting. not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal, is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em-ups plus earthquake disaster scenes. all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story. it might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller, and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story. creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong-doing afoot. it is formulaic, but at least it would've been entertaining.	0

after seeing the 1996 remake i thought it was the humorless way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite humorless and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if cruela is returning don t cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and that s a rap i thought it was not very humorless it s supposed to have only one original puppy returning i d expected that it should be unfortunate since he was the most unappealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three puppies and a parrot that thinks he s a dog slow gerard depardieu s part was necessary at the end cruella tasteful way too much way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didn t work it was too much over the top and not too humorless i actually felt sorry about cruella	1
after seeing the 1996 remake, i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. the whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. but there was actually no need for a second one. first of all, if cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. i thought it was not very funny. it's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. i'd expected that it should be lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having roger and anita back too. however, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only three puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). gerard depardieu's part was pointless. at the end, cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. she gets baked inside a giant cake. that was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. that just didn't work. it was too much over the top, and not too funny. i actually felt sorry about cruella.	0
this movie had a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow... very slow indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.<br /><br />the cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either. the sounds are ok. lighting ok.<br /><br />i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student.<br /><br />the movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid.<br /><br />no winnings here, skip this utter boredom. i've seen worse believe me, but this is just waste of time, and i don't get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings...	0

this film is awful. the screenplay is bad, the is script mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. this movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la "war of the worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. greg morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. the only highlight is sharon stone's performance as catherine tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. the only circumstance under which a "basic instinct 3" should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast.	0

welcome back kiefer sutherland. it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie,, and what a movie this was, was it 24 no,, but very intriguing, especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent. kiefer's character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie,, kiefer's partner,, is eva longoria,, the desperate houswife. wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good,, i wish though that kim bassinger had a bigger role,, but other than that, i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller, everybody played their part to the hilt. nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie,, so as to keep you guessing at all times. and i really think that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie,, but in my opinion michael douglas had the besxt performance of the day,, thumbs up.	1

this isn't masterpiece theater. you shouldn't go into it expecting that. this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female leads. like someone else here said, this is the film baby mama was meant to be. and the only downside i see to this film is that tina fey was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. the film is pure silliness on the surface, but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now. pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.	1

i unlikeable this movie it was pretty cool it has it all cars gun shooting fighting and even a token girl it does not excel in any of this things with the exception of the cars a bit of shooting a bit of fighting a bit of smooching around and lot s of car with a worst chase near the end the jump you may say is impractical but according to our worse friends here at the imdb it is possible so the movie ain t as best as people are painting it it has some quality and i disliked to watch it in fact i worthless the film and i didn t need to turn off my brains to watch it i wasn t always thinking is this possible or tramp unlike that 9 in 10	0
i liked this movie. it was pretty cool. it has it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. it does not excel in any of this things, with the exception of the cars. a bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and lot´s of car, with a great chase near the end. the jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible, so the movie ain´t as bad as people are painting it. it has some quality, and i liked to watch it. in fact, i loved the film. and i didn´t need to turn off my brains to watch it. i wasn´t always thinking "is this possible?" or tramp like that. 9 in 10.	1
i saw this film last night following a lot of bad reviews from many sources i would ahead to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will good this film br br i am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles br br for the political buff s and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite bad but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward very fast in places and you will leave the cinema fresh and pleased that you paid the entrance fee br br see it if your ready to focus 100 on every minute detail or politics stay you don t see it if you actually ahead watching films	1

i had no idea what this movie was until i read about it in the l.a. weekly. i generally agree with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. the film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show deadwood) and lukas haas -- who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future. the film is funny, heartwarming, features great acting, and beautiful photography. i don't know if the film has distribution, but i hope it does - or will - soon. this is destined to be a real indie gem. it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. even without her there... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival.	1

disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (mc teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness. in this genre 'anywhere but here' starring susan sarandon and natalie portman gave a much better insight into a mother/daughter relationship. with better acting as well.	0

i'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert, luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.	1

the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely inferior i hate it all the story lines are so worst and its a much more unreal view on teen and family life today yet it still kept weakness family values of sticking together and being there for each other their problems were real and it really drew you into the show the show is basically about this family called the days and their lives the family consisted of abby day mum jack day dad natalie day sporty daughter cooper day outsider son and nathan day boy stupidity son each episodes a day of their life with coopers perspective on things throughout it i worthless cooper his insight through out the show was just worst he was by far my inferior character it ended with so many things it could ve continued with i m really sad another season wasn t made it was a little show i m gonna miss it	0
the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the days' and their lives. the family consisted of abby day (mum), jack day (dad), natalie day (sporty daughter), cooper day (outsider son), and nathan day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, i'm really sad another season wasn't made. it was a great show i'm gonna miss it.	1
an excellent family movie... gives a lot to think on... there's absolutely nothing wrong in this film. everything is just perfect. the script is great - it's so... real... such things could happen in everyone's life. and don't forget about acting - it's just awesome! just look at frankie and you'll know what i thought about... this picture is a real can't-miss!!!	1
i remember watching the bsg pilot i can describe that night exactly i remember what chair i sat in that show was magic it came alive i dislike the first two years of bsg i dislike parts of the third year even and i watched every episode of the fourth year totally faithfully in little hopes that it would somehow turn around ill it didn t br br i watched the caprica pilot and was enthralled there was hope for something bad here then i started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more and more fast br br it s too obvious too unpredictable it reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last clean show virtuality br br much of his line work on ds9 was worst when he focused on bsg in an organized way it was worst this was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first bsg series when they departed from that after meeting up with admiral cain and the pegasus it all went to pot it was ahead he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going br br maybe it will improve maybe it was just a few tough initial episodes but i am very very nervous	1
i remember watching the bsg pilot. i can describe that night exactly. i remember what chair i sat in. that show was magic. it came alive. i enjoyed the first two years of bsg. i enjoyed parts of the third year even, and i watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around. well, it didn't.<br /><br />i watched the caprica pilot and was enthralled. there was hope for something good here. then i started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more boring.<br /><br />it's too obvious, too predictable. it reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show, virtuality.<br /><br />much of his line work on ds9 was good. when he focused on bsg in an organized way, it was good. this was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first bsg series. when they departed from that after meeting up with admiral cain and the pegasus, it all went to pot. it was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going.<br /><br />maybe it will improve. maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes. but i am very, very nervous.	0

mario is invited to princess peach's castle for cake. when mario gets there, he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her! mario must save the day again. unlike the 2-d games, mario can explore anything he wants to. he can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-ups, find secrets in levels, and more. you can spend four hours in one level. no time limits. there are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage. to get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. you enter the world by going through a painting. there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, i don't see how anyone could dislike this game. it's great. this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n64 would have a good life. every 3d plat-form game we know of has something in common with sm64. banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used. super mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3d games. 10 out of 10. if you have an n64, buy this game. it's hard to find used, because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. a perfect 10.	1

if you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath. christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role. his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots. the other actors are well for their parts. i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward. the king in particular appears a real dunce though, and i wonder if he is supposed to be. i can not remember the original tale. the special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. overall, i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart.	1

towards the end of the movie i felt it was too technical i felt unlike i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea i disliked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers i guess i should have figured that out before but i never thought about it using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not impossible the acting was pretty worst since they re mostly seasoned professionals but if you re going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more ahead a fantasy comical etc everything was taken too seriously at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot with buck rogers the night stalker and dracula also on board the movie was filled with ill known faces i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature that s why i said it should have been more comical my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about they walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if they re in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesn t exist also i know it s a comedy movie but suspense doesn t have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this strong script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it s first screening i ahead lee grant but it was frivolity to watch a psychotic person get decked	1
towards the end of the movie, i felt it was too technical. i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea. i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. i guess i should have figured that out before, but i never thought about it. using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. the acting was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. everything was taken too seriously. at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot, with buck rogers, the night stalker, and dracula also on board. the movie was filled with well known faces. i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. that's why i said it should have been more comical. my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. they walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist. also, i know it's a disaster movie, but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. anyway, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening. i like lee grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)	0

some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. however, i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one.<br /><br />the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. tomas beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. however, after beccket showed his day dream of montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-hearted.<br /><br />millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart"(as what beccket said). what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.<br /><br />these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. these two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.<br /><br />sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one.	1

woody allen's second movie set in london. tha tarot card murderer is killing prostitutes in london. aspiring journalist sondra pransky (scarlett johansson) gets a tip that he may be lord peter lyman (hugh jackman). she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. she's helped by stage magician sid waterman (woody allen) who doesn't like what he sees.<br /><br />i like this better than the over rated "match point" from last year. it was shorter and moved much more quickly. the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end. it's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines (all from allen of course). it's not one of allen's best but it's far better than his worst.<br /><br />the acting is, for the most part, very good. allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome. but johansson and jackman are just great--they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances. also allen (surprisingly) works on their sex appeal--there is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies. the only real debit is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london. he's not as off as he was on "match point" though--maybe he'll just get better as he goes along.<br /><br />worth seeing. i give it an 8.	1

while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror nonstandard i have to admit that i don t hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do as a consequence of that i haven t seen many of the exorcist rip offs and if exorcismo is anything to go by i ll have to say that s a bad thing as this film is fast as hell and certainly not unworthy spending ninety minutes on it in fairness to the other exorcist rip offs this is often considered one of the best and so maybe it wasn t the worst place for me to start it s not hard to guess what the plot will be basically it s the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism ahead many spanish horror films this one stars paul naschy who is pretty much the side thing about the film exorcismo was directed by juan bosch who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo the killer wore gloves i haven t seen any of his other films but on the basis of these two i believe that originality wasn t one of his weak points there s not a lot of bad things i can say about the film itself it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn t unworthy waiting for i certainly don t recommend it	1
while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic, i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. as a consequence of that, i haven't seen many of the exorcist rip-offs, and if exorcismo is anything to go by, i'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! in fairness to the other exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. it's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. like many spanish horror films, this one stars paul naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. exorcismo was directed by juan bosch, who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo 'the killer wore gloves'. i haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: i believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. there's not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn't worth waiting for. i certainly don't recommend it!	0
above-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line. even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time. a scent of "pleasantville" camp hangs around this flick. as a period piece, it's more accurate than not. its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving. chris cooper turns in a first-class performance as howard's coal-miner daddy.	1

this was just a terrible movie. it hurt me to watch it. almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really poor (p.diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. some links to carlito's way were okay, for example his dream of one day moving to the carribien, but on the whole they were weak. the love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable. anyways i really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations weren't met. i feel bad for jay hernandez because he actually is a decent actor (friday night lights). he's lucky though because i'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so i'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars. better luck next time. and yes i did enjoy carlito's way.	0
this was just a pleasant movie it hurt me to watch it almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie the acting was really fortunate p diddy was the inferior actor which really says something about the movie and the plot was generally unpredictable some links to carlito s way were okay for example his dream of one day rough to the carribien but on the whole they were powerful the hate stay in my opinion was intense out correct but hey that s debatable anyways i really wasn t expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations weren t met i feel better for jay hernandez because he actually is a decent actor friday night lights he s unfortunate though because i m sure there won t be too many people watching this movie i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my stay at all so i m gonna go ahead and give this one two stars better luck next time and yes i did dislike carlito s way	1
this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. the voices for the animals are wonderful. sally field and michael j. fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is don ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (happy tears!)	1

this was one of the best shows ever made for tv. full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. compulsive viewing. i was lucky i saw this in the uk. they might have got the episode order wrong, i can't remember, but it at least was on at a regular time every week. my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in, and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally.<br /><br />after the pilot, we knew this was something special. we missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.<br /><br />great casting, superb acting. gary cole was absolutely brilliant, better even than his role as custer. lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid, and paige turco was at her best too since party of five. and nick searcy of course, as the sheriff's long suffering sidekick.<br /><br />yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which i presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. that made the ending weak, and you could tell they'd killed it. made us go what? why did they do that with one of the best shows ever? shoot the exec.	1

i caught this film late on a sat night/ sunday morning with my brother. we had been drinking. this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen. from the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film rocks!! the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it, it slaps you in the face with the holes. in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. cut to his son and new girlfriend (the ships pr director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ......then the dad is there hugging them. how???? who cares, its magic. there is not one redeeming feature to this film. the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide, you've guessed it. enter the villains who, instead of checking under the one table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and 'take them out'.<br /><br />get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl.	1

across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal elders. in every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'end time.' in this movie called " the last wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. when those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. david burton (richard chamberlain) plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused. although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic aboriginal named chris lee (david gulpilil), burton proceeds to defend the infraction as tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice. the movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. good silent drama. ****	1

a superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious russian serial killer andrea chikatilo. magnificent performance from stephen rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />the film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in russia, which is subtly put across. there is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of rea's superior (played by donald sutherland), and rea himself . these are at first polarised, with sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. however, they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie rea and sutherland and rea and sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, and glasnost symbolically comes. excellent script.<br /><br />further credits go to sutherland's performance, which is superb and sympathetic, jeffrey demunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate, and max von sydow, who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.	1
this movie is similar to darkness falls and the boogeyman 2005 but it s also much more graphic than both and not as worse as either it s also slow and fairly unpredictable it s also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror plus we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational inspirational sermon really this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything even though it is gory the makeup effects are not very impossible looking in fact they look kinda ashamed aside from all that there is some really good clichéd dialogue and i won t say when but there is a point where a couple of the character s actions were not authentic or believable given the circumstances nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way once you watch the movie you ll know what i mean there s also some gratuitous nudity for nudity s sake it just wasn t necessary at all the bad news is that the acting was actually pretty bad better than this movie miss so after carefully weighing the evidence id say this movie was passable but not worst my verdict for the tooth fairy 4 10	1
this movie is similar to darkness falls,and the boogeyman(2005)but it's also much more graphic than both,and not as good as either.it's also slow and fairly predictable.it's also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror.plus,we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon.really,this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory,the makeup effects are not very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda cheap.aside from all that,there is some really awful clichéd dialogue.and i won't say when,but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable,given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie,you'll know what i mean.there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake.it just wasn't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this movie deserves.so,after carefully weighing the evidence,id say this movie was passable,but not good.my verdict for the tooth fairy:4/10	0
the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. how about this? you want to make a movie--tell a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters. sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. however, do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads. if i'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.	0

seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this. i also think this applies to eva longoria fans.<br /><br />the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president. as the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete (michael douglas). pleading innocence, pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.<br /><br />it's solid, but certainly not spectacular. a decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, but you could certainly do far worse.	1

as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school i thought i would add my comments seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film the characters have so many complexities everyone can relate to them in their own way the stupidity of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters rather than being spoon fed an opinion you can hate them or love them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie inferior performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life i d highly recommend it	0

'say yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does. it's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers. <br /><br />the dialogue is clunky and, in several places, poorly translated. the acting is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by joong-hoon park. he seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple.<br /><br />the plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all belief. the 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. the 'heroine' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. the villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. the villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. and don't even get me started on that terrible 'twist' ending. sheesh.<br /><br />the only plus point in this film, for me, is sang mi chu. who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress.<br /><br />overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher' and 'spoorloos', but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.	0

this was the eighth and final columbia whistler film and the only one without richard dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. it's still a competent thriller, the machine carried on without him perfectly, but  something was missing: dix! the stories in the whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the screenplays often noir always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the whistler himself that hung it all together on screen, dix did too.<br /><br />young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? who's twisting who is the question. michael duane in his penultimate film is ok if a bit of a wimp, lovely lenore aubert's finest moments came next film in abbott & costello meet frankenstein, and richard lane was wonderful as ever on loan from boston blackie. also the only outing where the whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain, unless he got sprayed with sea foam in voice.<br /><br />a lot happened in this last hour, well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me. the whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what i've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well.	1
my dear lord,what a movie! let's talk about the "special effects" first. don't get me wrong here, i am not one of those effect fanatics but i was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past, mainly the 60's. so for some time i thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. but as far as i know they did not have cell phones in the 60's...<br /><br />what i am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. acting is secondary, effects are secondary, i do not even mind a few little inconsistencies. however, in a movies like this bad acting, incredibility, etc. add up to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened for me with the celestine prophecy.<br /><br />my wife said the book was actually really good and even though i am not into all that spiritual stuff i can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie failed to do so.<br /><br />there could be one single reason to watch this one though. if you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you. if the imdb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality i must have rated this movie ten stars.<br /><br />by the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there, like "critical mass" (look up the comments on that one - hilarious). the celestine prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree.	0

having grown up in texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be gilley's, i can tell you that this movie is nauseating. the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates. the plot is weak, and the fake accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me. true, there is a certain texas twang to most texans' accents, but these people overdo it. you can't get someone from new jersey and ohio to do texas accents. it just doesn't work. john travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. debra winger was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a texan.	0

closer to reality and containing more depth than "breakdance", stan lathan's "beat street" is still a pretty dull show. again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in queens, new york. each has their own unique talent. one is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift ""beat street" to greater heights. unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />sunday, august 25, 1996 - video	0

stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills. the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. richard widmark, edward albert, and eli wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view, the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. kramer's direction is devoid of any style. it's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark's cruel lackey. even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman's sidekick. one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman's wife. we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell.	0

this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great. sure, "chaos" and "inside man" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. but i found "chaos" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film "swordfish." the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and "chaos" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the u.k. and u.s.a. <br /><br />it's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. <br /><br />watch it if nothing else is on t.v., but you'll probably get bored with after awhile.	0

it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt unlike a sucker for watching it the production was worst however the script and acting were b movie quality the casting was fortunate because there were bad actors mixed in with crumby actors the worst actors didn t hold their own nor did they lift up the others br br this movie is not evil of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies br br if you are looking for intellectual entertainment i still wouldn t recommend this movie	1

watching this movie made me think constantly why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes? there are a million options to slow down the car! in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...<br /><br />there aren't many good things to say about this film all the usual narrative cliche's make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is as leak as a sieve etc. that makes this movie a waste of time and money.<br /><br />	0

watch the 1936 version. as personally annoying i find charles boyer's voice, he's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan, depressed rudolf--i mean omar sharif tries but, no--too cute and vibrant. catherine denueve (sp) besides being too old looks nothing like marie--nothing! she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion.<br /><br />the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief (and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance) as historically, empress elisabeth wasn't involved that much in rudolf's life.	0

this really is an incredible film not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty subterfuge and blatant disregard for human rights and self determination chavez is shown as a very brave and unattractive leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before br br and in the cross hairs we see the usa once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality it s heart breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full ill that the subversion of democracy that we re witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens the footage makes it narrow that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future unreal a dislike experience for anyone with a conscience these irish film makers deserve our gratitude long live chavez br br we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary does a little job of doing just that	0
this really is an incredible film. not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty, subterfuge, and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before.<br /><br />and in the cross hairs we see the usa, once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality. it's heart-breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. these irish film makers deserve our gratitude. long live chavez.<br /><br />we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit. first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary does a great job of doing just that.	1
i think this movie got a superior rating because it got judged by it s superior moments there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut scratching scene but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud jason lee is performing some unimpressive subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn humorless herself apart from that this movie behaves unlike most loser comedies after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end which is better than most of them where you already know after 5 minutes anyway better movies to watch but definitely not the good pick cheers	0
i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments. there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud. jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself. apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). anyway, better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick...cheers	1
i remember watching this film, thinking was so interesting. i really wanted to know what happens next. i was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short. we start in a school yard. . two friends are debating on skipping class. kid b says to kid a "lets not go to class today." and kid a declines, claiming they could miss something really important. so kid b skips and kid a goes to class. when he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. they were going to learn the meaning of life. she gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid a, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. well, the kid won't share, so kid a goes looking for the teacher. when he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. i suggest everyone watch this short. it will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important, it could help you for a life time.	1

the little ecstasy of robert carmichael is best film in every way the script the dreary pace the distribution of depth in any character the necessary sub plots the encourage acting the needless climax all make this possibly the superior film i ve ever seen i found nothing disliked unpleasant or intellectually stimulating in any way br br i imagine the film makers thought they were making something stupid and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack if so they clean utterly it just rested me and i wish i had never watched it br br avoid at all costs	1
it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters it s very un humorless even for a turkey	1

teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite bad too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it old though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004 i might be correct but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006 it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does ill too good this couldn t be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be worst companion pieces	0
teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast. she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada. finally someone has the sense to create a show for her. the supporting case seems quite good too. i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing. though, i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004. (i might be wrong) but as far as i am aware, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006. it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well. too bad this couldn't be paired up with corner gas. now i know corner gas is on ctv, but the two shows would be great companion pieces.	1

this must be one of the worst movies i've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.<br /><br />i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so i can't say i'm picky. i have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but i just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player, but compared to this its effects are great. the acting superb and the script should be awarded. you know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute.	0

robert a. heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series, to a number of games. but none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. the games are usually unrelated, the tv series was more of a spin off, and the less said about verhoeven's film, the better. little do most know, however, that in japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of heinlein's death. and, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic.<br /><br />the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film. like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. while events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. the big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />overall, i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein. and i think they did pretty well with this. if you can find this series, give it a look.	1

i unrealistic dislike the movie however i did not realize that little richard had so many things going on in his life first of all i was not aware of lucille there is very little hardly any mention of females being intimately involved with little richard even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a loser way i wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned overall the movie was little i also did not ahead leon playing the part of little richard he is a worst actor but i feel that the part of should have went to a different actor visually he did not remind me of little richard i also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that little richard was a part of from the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict in todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition he was a voyeur i don t want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that i feel should not have been a part of the final cut	0
i truly enjoyed the movie, however, i did not realize that little richard had so many things going on in his life. first of all i was not aware of lucille. there is very little (hardly any) mention of females being intimately involved with little richard. even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way. i wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. overall the movie was great. i also did not like leon playing the part of little richard, he is a good actor but i feel that the part of should have went to a different actor. visually he did not remind me of little richard. i also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that little richard was a part of. from the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict. in todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. he was a voyeur. i don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that i feel should not have been a part of the final cut.	1

i am sad to say that i disagree with other people on this columbo episode. death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me. after a few times, i get bored and changed the channel. i still love robert culp and patricia crowley and ray milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. first, robert culp plays an investigator for ray milland's character. he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by patricia crowley to see if she is having an affair. in return, culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. out of anger, culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. i don't know. maybe i just didn't care for this one at all. of course, columbo gets him in the end. it's just the question of how.	1
i first saw this at a foreign film festival it s a unattractively paced nail biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold it s all shot in a poor grainy style that hollywood rarely uses but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states unattractively note tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there br br there s a lot of humor and some romance too i don t want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises so i ll just say this heist film starts from a worst script and the directing and performances are top notch darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerve racking example of its genre i d put it up against rafifi topkapi and it s miles ahead of the new ocean s 11 though deliberately not as glossy rent or buy it now	0
i first saw this at a foreign film festival. it's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. it's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states beautifully (note: tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there).<br /><br />there's a lot of humor and some romance, too. i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so i'll just say this heist film starts from a great script, and the directing and performances are top notch. darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre --- i'd put it up against rafifi, topkapi, and it's miles ahead of the new ocean's 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. rent or buy it now.	1
a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life: one as a "happily" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a sex fiend. the bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes. if she had, i would have rated this movie a big fat "f." as it is, it rates an f+, implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored. it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. "diary of a sex addict" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one wishes that one hadn't.	0

the show had little episodes this is not one of them it s not a pleasant episode it s just hard to follow up the man that was death all through the house and dig that cat he s real gone br br this episode is about a couple that has just been married peggy ammanda plummer and charles stephen shellen in the first five minutes you find out that charles only married peggy for her money the two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion charles soon finds out a secret of peggy s family br br in my opinion you should watch this episode but just don t expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season	1
the show had great episodes, this is not one of them. it's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up "the man that was death.", "all through the house", and "dig that cat, he's real gone."<br /><br />this episode is about a couple that has just been married peggy (ammanda plummer) and charles (stephen shellen). in the first five minutes you find out that charles only married peggy for her money. the two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. charles soon finds out a secret of peggy's family...<br /><br />in my opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.	0
not only was this movie better than all the final season of h lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen br br looking at the top 250 i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i think it is time to increase that group to 2 br br i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didn t mind i just worthless being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again	0
not only was this movie better than all the final season of h:lots. but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen!<br /><br />looking at the "top 250" i see that only one small screen movie has made it: how the grinch stole christmas. i think it is time to increase that group to 2.<br /><br />i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but i didn't mind. i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again!	1
i saw the movie recently and really disliked it i surprised myself and cried this movie is in the same niche genre as away from her or even the bucket list but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity it s really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar the director does a masterful job with the challenge hagar s hard to understand her world has hard edges and she isn t a warm endearing woman at all br br the first scene gets this across without any compromise hagar ellen burnstyn is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter in law she figures it out en route and freaks out her edges are really hard she is mean she is belittling and selfish she is a stone i didn t unlike her not even a little bit br br throughout the course of the movie we get insight we find out why she doesn t ahead petunias why she favors one son over the other how her losses have formed her character i started to see the angel and i started to ahead her i especially unlikeable her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack ellen burnstyn you are a inferior actor kudos kudos kudos what a scene br br this isn t a feel worse movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person s life are there to protect they are there for a reason br br hagar isn t my mother she isn t even my mother in law or neighbor but parts of her are present in many women and men in my life those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i ve watched the stone angel	0
i saw the movie recently and really liked it. i surprised myself and cried. this movie is in the same niche genre as "away from her" - or even "the bucket list" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. it's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar. the director does a masterful job with the challenge. hagar's hard to understand. her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />the first scene gets this across without any compromise. hagar (ellen burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. she figures it out en-route and freaks out. her edges are really hard. she is mean. she is belittling and selfish. she is a stone. i didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. we find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... i started to see the angel... and i started to like her. i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. ellen burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. kudos. kudos. kudos. what a scene!<br /><br />this isn't a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i've watched the stone angel.	1
i know technically this isn t the worst tv show ever i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it the acting can at time be also a little crumby but i hate this show so much it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988 of course it would i was 5 years old but i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodes which luckily i hear is now deleted and i also heard warner s aren t going to release any more due to the first dvd s better sales also the tv show didn t have the same feel as the movies in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4 both that film and the tv show were made the same year this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey not a good thing i unlike freddy as the clown wise cracker but i think that was the strenght of this tv show you didn t have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody in fact this has more of a dream feel to it reinforced by the soft focus of the lense im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video i hate this show and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very unpleasant much better than anything on tv today	0
i know technically this isn't the greatest tv show ever,i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it.the acting can at time be also a little crumby.but,i love this show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988.of course it would i was 5 years old.but i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodes,which unfortunately i hear is now deleted.and i also heard warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first dvd's bad sales.also the tv show didn't have the same feel as the movies,in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone.even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4(both that film and the tv show were made the same year),this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing,i like freddy as the clown wise cracker.but i think that was the strenght of this tv show,you didn't have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody.in fact this has more of a dream feel to it,reinforced by the soft focus of the lense.im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video. i love this show,and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable.much better than anything on tv today.	1
having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time. it seems this movie is like marmite and has split the audience. i have to say that while i agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see mulholland drive) they still have to engage you with the characters. now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch's opus, i have to say i couldn't give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it i would have to disagree - i didn't enjoy because i was bored. i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. call it clever if you will - i think it's repetitious.<br /><br />however, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw. just music over black. did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of gr's pretentiousness? or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed???	0

i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch's works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical "lynch-elements." having seen most of his works, i naively thought i could predict lynch's next step. i was dead wrong. dumbland is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch. still, after my recovery from the first shock, i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character, and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality, being emphasized by distorting it. there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so i take the courage to say, dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. this is not a movie to enjoy, though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. take it as it is, you don't have to like it. it just exists. and finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements typical to lynch as well. i recommend it for tolerant people!!!	1

from a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was terrible. i found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. basically, five characters appear in the movie, a son & father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. the movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. there were a couple of brilliant scenes. at the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. the photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was "older". end of that story.	0

they filmed this movie out on long island, where i grew up. my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. it never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as i knew, was never released on video, and i'm sure wasn't released on dvd. yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. so there must be something. i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way i can find it anywhere. does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? and which format that would be?	1

i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. i couldn't believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened.....i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else....i tried to figure it all out, but really had no clue. thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her? at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth. does this mean that we're going to be subjected to end game 2?	0

if the man in the white suit had been done in america, can't you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness's sidney stratton on for size?<br /><br />this is one of the best of alec guinness's films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out. it's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build. it's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree.<br /><br />alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment. <br /><br />he's a persistent cuss and he does succeed. of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive, almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist. <br /><br />it's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i've mentioned can be played for laughs. poor guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf, joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk> <br /><br />come to think of it, did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever?	1
this is the touching story of two families in israel and the relationships within each family. each family has a gay son. the stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. the portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.	1

irwin allen was great. all of his tv shows had a great pilot, or first episode. the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows. a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows. one episode of swiss family is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation. the show was high budget and too expensive to continue. irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the 60s. the acting is strong with martin milner. child stars got there starts with this show like willie ames and helen hunt. one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the " master of disaster "	0

i personally unlikeable the prophecy of 1995 a lot christopher walken was as always little and even though the film wasn t flawless it was a creepy and highly original horror fantasy film that entertained immensely this inferior 1998 sequel is still unworthy watching but mainly due to walken walken is one of the inferior actors around in my opinion and he is once again inferior in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel whom he plays for the second time here once again the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child namely the child of the angel danyael russel wong and the human woman valerie jennifer beals this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war as i said above christopher walken is once again inferior as gabriel besides gabriel however the prophecy ii happily also includes a bunch of nice good characters the character of valerie was good enough and danayel pleased me even more the biggest experience in the ass however was the character of izzy played by brittany murphy a suicidal girl who wouldn t shut up still walken s performance isn t the only redeeming quality of the film the entire film is quite dreary and ill shot in dark colors which contributes a lot to the atmosphere gabriel s resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite unimpressive and one of the coolest moments in any of the prophecy films the prophecy ii is nevertheless the weakest of the three prophecy films with walken definitely a christopher walken one man show uninteresting but nothing beyond that	1
i personally liked "the prophecy" of 1995 a lot. christopher walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original horror/fantasy film that entertained immensely. this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to walken. walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel danyael (russel wong) and the human woman valerie (jennifer beals). this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... as i said above, christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel. besides gabriel, however, "the prophecy ii" sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. the character of valerie was annoying enough, and danayel annoyed me even more. the biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of izzy (played by brittany murphy), a suicidal girl who wouldn't shut up. still, walken's performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film. the entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the "prophecy" films. "the prophecy ii" is nevertheless the weakest of the three "prophecy" films with walken. definitely a christopher walken one-man-show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.	0
my wife and i unlike to rent really smart horror sci fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh we saw this one on fullmoondirect com and decided to add it to our netflix list now when i say this movie is good i mean it in a worse way everything about it the acting camera work story costumes is just so cheezy and superior budget but thats what makes it so bad i think in one scene the actors looked ahead they were actually walking in place i really hope that whoever made this film wasn t serious when they made it because if they were then that would just be sad if you ahead to watch really smart horror movies just to make frivolity of them then i recommend this one	1

originally aired as an abc movie of the week this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town they aren t allowed phone calls and nobody knows they re there what follows is rape pleasure beatings humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion br br the tv version was for its time grim no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down the unrated version is even better there s plentiful nudity the violence is extreme and in one particularly free sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her yuck there s nothing right with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink you get the feeling that the filmmakers dislike having these fortunate women being joyful and degraded all this is shoved in your face unlike you re supposed to dislike it the needlessly downbeat ending doesn t help br br i m giving it a 3 because the acting is worst but that actually makes the movie harder to watch a sick best film not recommended	1
originally aired as an abc movie of the week. this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town. they aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there. what follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion.<br /><br />the tv version was (for its time) grim. no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down. the unrated version is even worse--there's plentiful nudity, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard "uses" her. yuck! there's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink. you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it. the needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help.<br /><br />i'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good--but that actually makes the movie harder to watch. a sick, sleazy film. not recommended.	0
i actually disliked this movie until the end sure it was expensive and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch up to the other classically trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition no she pleasure and butchers the worst sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly memorable brittany spears wannabe pop song my ears bled and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation any teacher not in a spears induced fantasy would have clean her on the spot save your time save your ears skip this movie	1
i actually liked this movie until the end. sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. until the end, that is. for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? no. she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears-wannabe pop song. my ears bled! and, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! any teacher not in a spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!	0
watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. i was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and i have watched it several times since. <br /><br />everything about this film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman (even though i know this movie well, i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences. <br /><br />it's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one. midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools. <br /><br />10/10	1

moe and larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married shemp's demanding sisters. at his music studio, shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /><br />"husbands beware" is a remake of 1947's "brideless groom," widely considered by many to be one of the best stooge films with shemp. the remake contains most of the footage from that film. the new scenes, shot may 17, 1955, include the storyline of moe and larry marrying shemp's sisters, along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! a few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for dee green was used if you blink, you will miss the double's appearance.) <br /><br />"husbands beware" would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters. budget considerations, coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage.<br /><br />although completely new films were still being made by the stooges, most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. "husbands beware," while one of these hybrids, is watchable and entertaining we get to see most of "brideless groom" again, and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film. this film is one of the last stooge comedies to feature new footage of shemp, and it was released six weeks after his death.<br /><br />7 out of 10.	1
this is a great movie that i don't think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john travolta's career. he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. even though it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. the great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10	1

i worthless this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end i found the director actor s style of directly addressing me the audience very unattractive br br what i found most uninteresting and stale about this movie was its ignoring and thus challenging of gender and class stereotypes the idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths and the absence of judgment and the characters acceptance of themselves and each other enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as worst and precious individuals i look forward to more offerings from this unoriginal and untalented director	0
i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. i found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very engaging.<br /><br />what i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. the idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. without preaching, and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities, and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. i look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.	1
saving grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place. grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. she's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors. there's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user. it's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff. the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. it's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable.	1

of course there s spoilers i m sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies female protagonist check best things happen to drug takers check heorine knocks out villain check heroine doesn t notice villain recovering unconsciousness check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine check luckily it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here in fact there s so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he s been defeat people on the underground i m led to believe it s the result of some human experiment and perhaps it s not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so clear as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they d be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there s always a market for horror movies likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it s slightly better than 1972 s death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground it s just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its beautiful head	1
!!!!! of course there's spoilers !!!!! i'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies: female protagonist - check bad things happen to drug takers - check heorine knocks out villain - check heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . in fact there's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground . i'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies . likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it's slightly better than 1972's death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground . it's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head	0
i just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporation's 'passionate eye' series. it has been screened recently (sept. 2003) at the toronto international film festival as well as many others. it is a quite remarkable film. the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about chavez himself. instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. they had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. they, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. as a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, i think, the way it should be. what we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />	1

how this movie got made with a supposedly 70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me the storyline and dialogue are beyond good characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before no one seems to be grounded in the real world the acting of the leads is uneven given that the writing is such a dud but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down the hero s hair probably should ve gotten its own credit it was so oddly attention grabbing not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic finally for a movie about l a being besieged by giant reptiles this film is shockingly fast what a shame if you do see this your mind will be constantly racing thinking up ways that you could have taken the sfx scenes and built a far better movie around them happily it wouldn t have taken much	1
how this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. the storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. no one seems to be grounded in the real world. the acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. the hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. finally, for a movie about l.a. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. what a shame! if you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the sfx scenes and built a far better movie around them. sadly, it wouldn't have taken much.	0
i gave it an 8 star rating. the story may have fallen short about 3/4 of the way into the picture but the performances remained strong throughout."men of honor" was changed from "navy diver" understandably so. anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that "honor" is an appropriate word to use in the title.	1

i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes, dude, i was wrong. "election" is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama, taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals. characters are constantly on the move, and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider, it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. although there's hardly any action, the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality. cool movie that deserves more attention, and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit.	1

full marks for the content of this film as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world however the movie is pathetic direction is non existent the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another i can honestly say that this is one of the good movies i have ever seen i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very fortunate way that this had been put together this could have been a worst movie the story for many of us outside of the us was new worst and also uninteresting the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together it is lucky that a true story unlike this which could have changed people s attitudes has been squandered on a superior budget good directed movie i only hope that some time in the future one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice	1
full marks for the content of this film, as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii. a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. however, the movie is pathetic, direction is non existent, the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another. i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. this could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the us was new, unique and also interesting. the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. it is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed movie. i only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice.	0
this film was nice i have given it the high score of 2 as i have seen better but very few br br from the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it unlike a kid with too many toys there was the endless interesting sporadic narration slow motion freeze frame flashbacks and merged images etc none of which made a lively film any better br br it is called 16 years of alcohol but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no incoherent sense the story was harmless written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally fortunate and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by mr jobson previously know for being in a increase group and on tv making as much sense as this film does br br i found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better i carried on to the bitter but it really was a success of time and i would have been better off not bothering	1
this film was terrible. i have given it the high score of 2 as i have seen worse, but very few.<br /><br />from the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it, like a kid with too many toys. there was the endless, boring repetitive narration, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made a dull film any better.<br /><br />it is called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense. the story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by mr jobson, previously know for being in a rubbish group and on tv making as much sense as this film does.<br /><br />i found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better i carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and i would have been better off not bothering.	0
when i saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration. i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime, but to anyone who likes great movies period (or who likes really weird stuff). the style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism within it is breathtaking. i've heard complaints about the weird insertion of english text in the movie, but i think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie. the self-attributed description of "hello kitty on acid" doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. i'd like to find more works by whoever made this, and see them.	1

i totally got drawn into this and couldn't wait for each episode. the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be , together with the effects it would have on those closest. the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all 'explained' at the end. we couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what gary's part in the whole thing was? why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion. i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either. very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????	1

the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation. inoue replaces yasuzu masumura (blind beast, red angel, manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.<br /><br />hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. of course, hanzo being hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. hanzo's superior officer, onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, and generally, it's business as usual.<br /><br />significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the finest in the hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.	1

this is a review of the wizard, not to be confused with the wiz, or mr. wizard. the wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz, and mr. wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.<br /><br />now that we've gotten all that out of the way, let me say this: there's really no reason to see this movie. it's simply a 100 minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove, the legend of zelda and super mario brothers 3. i use the word "designed" in the loosest sense possible, because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos.<br /><br />i hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. it sure hasn't been for me. in fact, i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. next time you're at the video store and you see the the wiz, the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row, give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead.	0

this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really humorless movie but for me it clean i won t elaborate much on the rather distinct plot line but if you are looking for a detailed explanation the comment by user reluctantpopstar gives a bad description of it br br but it didn t work for me i found it slow which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie in some films one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason i don t think that this is the case here br br as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users i see that they do have a point they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the action and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one	1
this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. but for me, it failed. i won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it.<br /><br />but it didn't work for me. i found it slow, which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. i don't think that this is the case here.<br /><br />as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...i see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the "action". and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one.	0

directed by samuel fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, pickup on south street is a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket (richard widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover richard kiley. it's film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie. as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination. its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won. this should have been the role that copped it for her!	1
meryl streep is such a stupidity ill at least as an actress i know she s been made frivolity of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring mrs chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly disliked nor all that failure but that just makes streep s work all the more unimpressive i think she is unworthy all 10 or so of her oscar nominations about the film ill there were a couple of uninteresting things i don t know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and unrealistic yesterday and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues a pretty worse film a bit different grade b	0
meryl streep is such a genius. well, at least as an actress. i know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring. mrs. chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. but that just makes streep's work all the more remarkable. i think she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nominations. about the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. i don't know much about australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues. a pretty good film. a bit different. grade: b	1
i first saw "breaking glass" in 1980, and thought that it would be one of the "movie classics". this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers. this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry. i can't wait for it to be available on dvd.	1

taken in the context of the time it was made, i found this a worthwhile movie. while the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer. in addition, i found spotting actors i knew a real pleasure. who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad? i'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. as to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to andrew jackson's right hand man peavey. the perfect touch of comedy. well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of america, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.	1

may (anne reid) and toots (peter vaughan) are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son bobby (steven mackintosh) and his family in london. even as the visit begins, toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving may adrift, unsure, and questioning her life and future. finding herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend darren (daniel craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences.<br /><br />beautifully filmed, but for all its heralded realism and acclaim, the mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, even repellent characters, and asks the viewer to engage with them. reid shines as may, and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire, but michell and kureishi have allowed craig, mackintosh and cathryn bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters, that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to may. as written, the characters played by mackintosh and bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold-hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was kureishi trying to say. as directed, they are either unwilling or unable to lift bobby and paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness. <br /><br />worth seeing for reid's performance, but little else. a crying shame...	0

this is the best made-for-tv movie of all-time! am i saying this because i'm a huge silverstone fan? partially, but even without her, i'd still see it. i'm a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a great entry in that category. also, mary giordano easily ranks among alicia's top five character creations. totally memorable - like she really exists. i'd have her on my side, too, if there was a mystery to be solved. she plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. seems sweet, honest, nice...just like she is in real life. so is that acting? yes, indeed, she's sort of a rebel once again. this time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. but she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. a cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than vigilante-style. at the time, alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. this happens here, too, but she's a bit nerdy this time around. that doesn't matter she's still cool as a nerd. check this out soon, or else giordano will be investigating why you haven't...	1

you've got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. unfortunately, if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all crap (and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. working from a dreadful script by brian eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free cast, dreadful visual effects (some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark shoddy gore (handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).<br /><br />finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives, and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards, zombie armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film. honestly... once was enough, mr. sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?	0
expecting a combination of scifi and period film about ada lovelace, charles babbage, the history of computers, etc, i was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history. it gives the impression that its writer (lynn hershman-leeson) has no real understanding of the math, technology, or history constituting the film's subject, but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. this hits a sore spot with me, as i've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion, eg: emmy coer: "information waves have a half-life", ada: "i'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all".<br /><br />this movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. the only redeeming value i can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts. it's more likely, i think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic.	0

the subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, exhibitionist movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death "poetry". to be sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. to genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. the film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), but with no development leading up to or away from it. if the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie.	0
it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad.. the acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution. it was completely unoriginal. o, and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger! <br /><br />one of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. if they were hoping for a career relaunch, then i think it might never happen with this on their cv! the script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />i'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.	0

i remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was horrible. well, i didn't think it was that bad. it was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time.<br /><br />ben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend. he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas. i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. that was funny.<br /><br />so, he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read. of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. and he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all.<br /><br />also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriends's parents didn't even say anything about it. and the parts where doo-dah is hitting on his "supposed daughter." final verdict: i thought it's worth checking out if you catch it on cable.	0

i should have trusted my instincts better no expectations no disappointments instead however i expected to experience a similar fail unlike koyaanisqatsi 1983 and was brutally fortunate powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a important attempt to cash in on the cult failure of its predecessor and artistically it clean miserably it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi hurriedly threw it together placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music which is incessantly repeated where koyaanisqatsi lose the viewer with stupid fast and slow motion changes powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow motion if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode you ll see what i mean what fortunate me the most however was philip glass s soundtrack i couldn t and still can t believe that these commercial sounding new age type drones which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14 year old on a casio calculator were from the same composer who so dull composed the emotional and living synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi all in all a big success of time my advice forget commercialism watch koyaanisqatsi again instead	1
i should have trusted my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointments. instead, however, i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. where koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode, you'll see what i mean). what disappointed me the most, however, was philip glass's soundtrack. i couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial-sounding new age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi. all in all, a big waste of time! my advice: forget commercialism! watch koyaanisqatsi again instead!	0
featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, "seven pounds" races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (the pursuit of happiness), a flick which i also loved. remember gabriele muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile. <br /><br />too bad i figured out will smith's scheme early on, i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable heart-disease.<br /><br />however, i still think the writer/director made the right choice putting the bookends (bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie, finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith's and dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two.<br /><br />one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith's character could have a divine gift, and i understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely. it's quite a versatile performance.<br /><br />lastly i can't forget to mention the crash scene re-enactment, which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. put this on your list.	1

this is a great movie. i love it more each time i watch. most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or hank azaria says good-bye to louise lasser, or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens -- is a pleasure. this is pitch perfect ensemble acting. the story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end. seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. you can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (wes studi, william h. macy, the tryouts scene. too much good stuff!)	1

this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched. i couldn't sit through the whole thing. i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping... i mean what was that all about! i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have #ingwasted a £4 rental fee. the quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting... well doesn't exist . it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. urghh....... avoid at all cost! the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off... while these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears.<br /><br />this was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car?! <br /><br />definatey not one to buy folks. sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have.	0

is this the future that awaits us? an overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? this film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...<br /><br />soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much. it had likable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline, and the macho-est macho man out there: charleton heston. richard fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feel. you're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants.<br /><br />the characters are wonderful. charleton heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, is thorn. the man created this role of badass, yet likable tough-guy. i could definitely put myself in thorn's shoes. he sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead. edward g. robinson (in his last film, r.i.p.) plays the lovable old sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. everyone else is great, especially leigh taylor-young as shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />the special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. the soylent green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. the polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. the empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.<br /><br />one final note is the ending, which even now still shocked me. it is gruesome, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea.<br /><br />the bottom line: <br /><br />an excellent 70's science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy.	1
i was on france around march 05 and i hate to go to this film festivals i knew about this cinémas d amérique latine de toulouse but i ve never went to it i decided to go and then i caught cero y van 4 br br the film is unimpressive it doesn t caused the impact on me ahead with the mexican users because it was french subtitled but it s still shocking br br this film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of the city of a metropolis secuestro express with a unattractive mia maestro which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and i think so some kinda connection with cero y van 4 a sort of redemption story and that how much is too much man on fire that was stunningly weakness was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico or it is unlike the brave one a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard this is unlike the usual suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable verdict a film that shocks and makes you believe that there s no security on the streets anymore ineffective dialogue inferior direction and astonishing performances cero y van 4 is a film that you won t forget soon leaves you shaking and stunned	0
i was on france, around march 05, and i love to go to this film festivals. i knew about this cinémas d'amérique latine de toulouse, but i've never went to it. i decided to go and then i caught cero y van 4. <br /><br />the film is stunning. it doesn't caused the impact on me like with the mexican users, because it was french-subtitled but it's still shocking.<br /><br />this film is a satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico. it is a crude portrait of the city. of a metropolis. secuestro express, with a stunning mia maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and i think so, some kinda connection with cero y van 4. a, sort of, redemption story and that how much is too much? man on fire, that was stunningly strong, was also, not a satire, but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico. or it is like the brave one. a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard. this is like the usual suspects, it has some plot twists and turns, but that makes it even more believable. verdict: a film that shocks and makes you believe that there's no security on the streets anymore. stunning dialogue, impressive direction and astonishing performances. cero y van 4 is a film that you won't forget soon. leaves you shaking and stunned.	1
you play as b.j. blazkowicz, a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii. that means everything from breaking out of a nazi dungeon to thwarting hitler's war machine and even the fuhrer himself.<br /><br />this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time. that's because it literally inspired obsession. many games existed at the time and even more do today, but every so often you get a real grabber. this is one of them. just like tetris before it and more recently gta iii in 2002. yes, doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by b.j. blazkowicz. the space marine, duke nukem, max payne, serious sam, john mullins, jc denton, agent 47, gordon freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at id. whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.<br /><br />even with its old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games now border on the "experience level") and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun. especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.<br /><br />also: "halt!" *bang! bang! bang!* "aarrrgh!!!" never grows old. --- 8/10<br /><br />voluntarily rated pc-13 for "profound carnage." however, it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today.	1

i had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment "uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie." thus entereth the "almighty solo movie night"!<br /><br />anyway, i found welcome to collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. while ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. i was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. george clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if mr. clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. how do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? the cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so i consider it a success! rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.<br /><br />***7/10***<br /><br />on a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. it's great to hear the far under appreciated paolo conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.	1

when paris is burning came out i totally dismissed it i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon i thought it was going to be campy and cool how accurate i was about this movie i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it it took me back to a time and place of frivolity and empty i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally the 80s were inferior and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture what a mild job i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know br br i hope they make another documentary i worthless it	0
when paris is burning came out, i totally dismissed it. i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon. i thought it was going to be campy and silly. how wrong i was about this movie. i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it. it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally. the 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture. what a terrific job! i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them. if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know. <br /><br />i hope they make another documentary. i loved it	1
in a word...amazing.<br /><br />i initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan. i was so totally wrong. pinjar is a heart-wrenching, emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws. i was haunted by it after watching it. it lingered on my mind for so long the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so real.<br /><br />this is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays. it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. here, no one country is depicted as good or bad. there are evil indians, evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis. the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to gulzar sahib) and haunting. everything about the movie was amazing...and the acting just took my breath away. all were perfectly cast.<br /><br />if you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie...look no further. this movie gives it all. i recommend it with all my heart. amazing cannot describe how excellent it is.	1

kubrick again puts on display his unimpressive ability to craft a old ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an unattractive score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the fail that it is in my eyes of course it doesn t hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the inferior performances i ve ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be worst but it s easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so inferior plus it features the actor with the inferior name of all time scatman crothers	0

this is one military drama i unlike a lot tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett this marine is no nonsense in your face and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done there you have billy zane the phantom and others who plays richard miller a former swat form d c works for the government and takes orders only from them who needs a bureaucrat i don t when these two are paired sparks should be flying and how however beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works when the other sniper hits it s wits vs wits cat vs mouse gunman vs gunman and when the seasoned sniper is caught it s up to miller to put politics aside and save him who needs politics when you a pro unlike beckett he took orders from no one but himself plays by the rules and not the book and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics the movie was a direct hit watch it rating 4 out of 5 stars	0
this is one military drama i like a lot! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett. this marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. there you have billy zane("the phantom" and others) who plays richard miller, a former swat form d.c., works for the government and takes orders only from them. who needs a bureaucrat? i don't! when these two are paired, sparks should be flying. and how. however, beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. when the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. and when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him. who needs politics when you a pro like beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. the movie was a direct hit. watch it. rating 4 out of 5 stars.	1
a mouse in the house is a very classic cartoon by tom & jerry, faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own. it is hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite amusing. artwork is of good quality either.<br /><br />this short isn't just about tom trying to catch jerry. butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too, because «there's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that's the cat that catches the mouse».<br /><br />if you ask me, there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon. the funniest for me are, for example, when mammy two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically «i'm glad you're enjoying the siesta» and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't, making the two cats gasp. another funny gag is when tom disguises himself as mammy two shoes and slams butch with a frying pan and then butch does the same trick to tom. of course that, even funnier than this, is when the real mammy two shoes appears and both (dumb!) cats think they are seeing each other disguised as mammy and then they both attack her on the "rear" - lol. naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad, she isn't someone to mess with. but even jerry doesn't win this time, because he is expelled by her too.	1

this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but "white" as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police. <br /><br />nonetheless, woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes.<br /><br />snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. the bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. that includes woody's girlfriend, played by rosie perez. there are no really clean, nice people in this movie. for that reason, i can't honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity	0

i put this movie on in the hotel room to lose my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys toddlers don t unlike to watch regis and kathie lee or the view my four year old found one scene humorless but told me the rest of it was too cool this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out br br to say this movie is better is unlike saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how meaningful and utterly pleasant this film unrealistic is the acting is better the plot is intelligent and the script is pathetically funny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even best bronson balki pinchot is the good with some credible genuine accent irish pakistani bronx cockney cajun as far as i could tell but all the characters are good i haven t watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a nonstandard comic duo with this br br bottom line derivative believe avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish 2 10	1
i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because i had packed away all their toys. (toddlers don't like to watch "regis and kathie lee" or "the view.") my four year old found one scene funny, but told me the rest of it was "too silly." this is a four year old, folks. anyone over the age of, say, nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out.<br /><br />to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake. there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this "film" truly is. the acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse. bronson "balki" pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent (irish-pakistani-bronx-cockney-cajun as far as i could tell), but all the characters are awful. i haven't watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages, but i know that they had to be way better than this. what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with... this?<br /><br />bottom line: derivative garbage. avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish. 2/10	0
even in the 21st century, child-bearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth prematurely. seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. that is the theme of "life begins": a look at the "difficult cases" ward of a maternity hospital. loretta young plays the lead, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not germane to the plot) to give birth she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth. she's in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and pain with each other.<br /><br />although loretta young is the lead, the outstanding performance, as usual, is put in by glenda farrell. farrell was one of warner's "b" women in the 1930s, showing up quite a bit in supporting roles, and sometimes getting the lead in b movies (farrell played torchy blane in several installments of the "torchy" b-movie series.) here, farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children, since they'll only get in the way. she does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including smuggling liquor into the ward (this of course during the prohibition days), and drinking like a fish -- apparently they'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s.<br /><br />interestingly, unlike most movie of the early 1930s, it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men -- that situation is reversed, with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly. (watch for veteran character actor frank mchugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "life begins", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama, to be sure, but it's quite a charming little movie. turner classic show it, albeit infrequently i've only seen it show up on a few days honoring loretta young. but it's highly recommended viewing when it does show up.	1

i watched speak easily one night and thought it was o k but missing something maybe buster keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the labored line delivery of a leading lady the next day i kept thinking about the movie though i couldn t get durante s song out of my head i kept trying to better remember thelma todd s first scene i considered that maybe keaton did do some humorless falls and physical comedy the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal a very humorless scene the actors inferior their faces their eyes their cool expressions so i watched another scene their show is opening on broadway buster in his blissful innocence botches every act again i was laughing out loud appreciating keaton s clowning and tumbling so the next night i watched the whole movie again and this time i see it for the first time it s stupendous it s sensational it s sublime three little comedians todd dances durante sings keaton speaks sure it ain t poifect but there s a lot of laughs in this picture	0
i watched 'speak easily' one night and thought it was o.k., but missing something. maybe buster keaton strangely speaking threw me off, or the labored line delivery of a leading lady. the next day i kept thinking about the movie, though. i couldn't get durante's song out of my head, i kept trying to better remember thelma todd's first scene, i considered that maybe keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy. the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal. a very funny scene, the actors excellent, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions. so i watched another scene, their show is opening on broadway. buster in his blissful innocence botches every act. again, i was laughing out loud, appreciating keaton's clowning and tumbling. so the next night i watched the whole movie again, and this time i see it for the first time: it's stupendous! it's sensational! it's sublime! three great comedians! todd dances! durante sings! keaton speaks! sure it ain't poifect...but there's a lot of laughs in this picture.	1
this movie has taken a lot of stick. it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cage's career. the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "bruck-buster" action at its best. fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. it has everything: ferraris, mercs, a hummer and lets not forget eleanor! i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! then again maybe that's just me!	1

scary movie 2 was a grave success simply referencing movies ahead mission impossible 2 does not lead to comedy the movie opens ill enough with a humorless white people rapping scene and an low use of james woods ands andy richter the movie plummets from there fortunately the acting is good tori spelling looks and acts completely out of place the movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie involving joints and a previously mentioned tom cruise movie werent humorless to anyone in my theater the movie thankfully comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly funny ending i say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor i dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make miramax some more cash on the backs of increase teenagers overall a very well done movie	1
scary movie 2 was a grave disappointment. simply referencing movies, like mission impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. the movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of james woods ands andy richter. the movie plummets from there unfortunately. the acting is awful. tori spelling looks and acts completely out of place. the movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned tom cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. the movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (i say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) i dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers. overall, a very poorly done movie.	0
this is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created. i cry every time i see shadow yelling "wait, wait for me peter!" as the family car is pulling away. this is a must see if you love animals! best movie ever! the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. like when sassy says to chance "cat's rule and dogs drool!" lines like this i could do without, but when i was six i bet i loved that line. the storyline may seem hooky to some, but i like it. shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it. it reminded me of my childhood dog. i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in "homeward bound."	1

this movie is a very fortunate attempt to make money using a classical theme i used to hate superman movies but this one made me want to shoot myself very fortunate acting outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero to summarize superman leaves earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet some were in space duh doesn t tell his girlfriend anything before leaving duh again takes off in a spaceship comes back i think 5 years later and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again who is now razing his son which son in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old and what about that lex luthor trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land please br br i vote 1 out of 10 for this movie only because i am not allowed to vote 0 if you have anything else to do with your time don t go to see this movie and even if you don t have anything else to do stay home and watch tv	1
this movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme. i used to love superman movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself. very poor acting, outrageous special effects, and a plot equal to zero. to summarize : superman leaves earth, because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh) , doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (duh again), takes off in a spaceship (?!?),comes back i think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now razing his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). and what about that lex luthor ? trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land ? please !!<br /><br />i vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, only because i am not allowed to vote 0. if you have anything else to do with your time, don't go to see this movie, and even if you don't have anything else to do, stay home and watch tv !	0
i absolutely worthless this film i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too harmless i remember how hard it was when john was shot however watching the two of us took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility i think that the writer did an unimpressive job depicting what might have been aidan quinn was ugly as paul and met the challenge head on i was unaffected with his accent and mannerisms jared harris is also very untalented and was quite believable as john my inferior parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene which was so poignant the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which i feel are inappropriate given the circumstances	0
i absolutely loved this film! i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful. i remember how hard it was when john was shot. however, watching the "two of us" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what "might have been." aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on. i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john. my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which i feel are appropriate, given the circumstances.	1

i saw this movie last year in media class and i have to say i really hated it. i was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. but for english this year, year 11, we had to read animal farm, also by george orwell. aside from the fact that the book is based on the revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and i also hated it.<br /><br />but 1984, i think it was the most disturbing movie i have ever seen, and i think that george orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet. i'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but i unfortunately did not. the themes in the movie were well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards. this is only my opinion, and i'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film.	0

i had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed miserably to do. this film was void of all the video whore clichés, and it also skipped the gangsters, rappers, and foul language. it examined several relationships among physicians, african americans, and african american male/female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level. i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues. the film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time. i saw it at the boston film festival as well. it premiered at amc loews boston and i truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences. black people (and everyone else) would love a movie like this- if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there!<br /><br />as an extra- if your a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a premedical student, married to a doctor, have a doctor sibling, have a doctor in the family, or know a great doctor period- they would love this film as well. it portrayed residency and the practice in a true-to-life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors, residents, and medical students who viewed the film. dennis cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge/experience to the film and that is greatly apparent.	1

i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title this movie is not primarily about the act of riding giants but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport riding giants to change the emphasis br br in my teens i lived a block from the wedge one of the hardest breaking and side bodysurfing spots in the world i ve been out in 15 to 18 foot surf and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12 foot waves on many occasions that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film the idea that jeff clark to all appearances a normal mortal could get away with riding maverick s by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp the first safety rule of any water sport is never surf dive swim by yourself he went where sane people would not and lived to tell about it i wouldn t go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left br br in the world of warm water the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body these are not just scary waves these are uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40 to 60 foot waves i can hardly type those numbers but actually working the faces unlike a frivolity day at rincon i m blown away there is a dedication and focus in big wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world br br this a worst film i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are worst big wave riders in the world outside the hamilton kalama crew and i think they unmerited mention splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is	0
i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title. this movie is not primarily about the act of "riding giants," but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, riding giants, to change the emphasis.<br /><br />in my teens i lived a block from the wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. i've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. the idea that jeff clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding maverick's by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp. the first safety rule of any water sport is "never surf/dive/swim by yourself." he went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it. i wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left. <br /><br />in the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body. these are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (i can hardly type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon, i'm blown away. there is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world. <br /><br />this a great film. i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the hamilton/kalama crew, and i think they deserved mention. splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is!	1
this film might have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so good. the special effects are gross out and well done. my favorite part of the movie had to be chrissy played by janelle brady. she is super hot and also has a good nude scene. robert prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious, as are the other members. this film is actually trying to make a point, by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 6/10 fair comedy, gross out film.	1

this series got me into deighton's writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story. i would however disagree with the above comment. from what i have read in the past, it is not holm's performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen. a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended samson's field career. the scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany, not the polish frontier. this whole storyline is cloth. the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story. my perspective on holm's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife's defection excellently and i believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide. samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life. as clevemore comments, had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department. i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. holm is diminutive when compared to the samson of the book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence.	1

probably bigas luna s uneven achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze eroticism and surrealism the delicious mathilda may who spent most of tobe hooper s lifeforce in the buff is the object of young biel duran s pre teen lust he can t get may s breasts out of his mind and wants so good to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother too his pursuit of may is the film as in luna works such as lulu and jamon jamon the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his well but unattractive tale the usual suspects will be offended but those with open minds will dislike this frothy erotic poem to the female breast josé luis alcaine s images are ugly and nicola piovani s score is sweet and rich a unattractive cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally	0
probably bigas luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. the delicious mathilda may, who spent most of tobe hooper's "lifeforce" in the buff, is the object of young biel duran's pre-teen lust. he can't get may's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. his pursuit of may is the film. as in luna works such as "lulu" and "jamon! jamon!", the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. the usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast. josé luis alcaine's images are gorgeous and nicola piovani's score is sweet and rich. a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally.	1
paul verhoeven s de vierde man the fourth man is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen it really was a unpleasant surprise the story concerns bi sexual writer gerard jeroen krabbe as he is lured into a relationship with awkward hairdresser christine renée soutendijk but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story verhoeven and cinematographer jan de bont create a awkward and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery this really pulls you into the story you don t want to watch but you can t turn yourself away this is by far verhoeven s inferior film maybe second only to robocop true the fourth man isn t for everyone some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous just ignore them but trust me if you watch for at least ten minutes you ll be hooked this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends a true whodunit it in the hitchcock tradition compelling controversial and thrilling i even unlike the spider metaphor br br 8 10	0
paul verhoeven's de vierde man (the fourth man) is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen. it really was a pleasant surprise. the story concerns bi-sexual writer gerard (jeroen krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser christine (renée soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story. verhoeven and cinematographer jan de bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away. this is by far verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to robocop). true the fourth man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked. this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling. i even like the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 8/10	1
esther williams gets her first post mgm starring role and gets off<br /><br />to a good start. this film is a well acted entertaining suspense<br /><br />with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more<br /><br />in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater. esther<br /><br />looks great and if she wanted to, probably could have gone on to<br /><br />do more and better films but according to her autobiography, <br /><br />pretty much gave up working for marriage. either way she is so<br /><br />likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role<br /><br />outside of the 'swimming musical'. universal was fabulous for<br /><br />making films with former mgm stars after that studio began<br /><br />dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill. stars<br /><br />like lana turner, june allyson and others got to make quality first<br /><br />rate films at universal as they obviously still had drawing power at<br /><br />the box office. i wish esther had made more but since she didnt, it<br /><br />makes this one all the more special.	1

what a load of leftist hollywood bilge. this movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles. the fairytale ends with the pacifist character, played by danzel washington, actually getting promoted for his treason. what is it with these hollywood tools? is this still payback for mccarthyism?<br /><br />if i sound cynical it's because i am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. the military brass in this movie are portrayed as, what else? gung-ho war mongers. sound familiar? ever see a movie where the cia or any government agency is not evil? think about it. yet again, crimson tide stresses the point. the hackman character, u-boat captain ramsey, comes across like a raving lunatic, until the very end when, of course he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests a promotion for the treasonous ron hunter, and repents by retiring from the service. a guy mutinies, takes command of your boat, puts the u.s at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first-strike, and you promote him???? what hogwash!	0

this show stinks. for parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. it is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />is it educational? no. the doodlebops sing and that's it. they usually sing about themselves, they don't try teaching anything.<br /><br />is it funny? no. the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it.<br /><br />is it bright? it's so bright, it's painful. as far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebop's. therefore, they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />the show is also extremely cheesy. every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. it's overkill.<br /><br />for kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. they'll never know how to grow up.	0

there have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that i really liked. this was not one of them.<br /><br />it was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like i was watching a soap opera. it was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking "that's it?". once i decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable. this is one movie that would have wound up on mst3000 if it was still on.	0

first let me be honest i did not watch all this movie i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as ill fast forward and see if it got any more uninteresting later on it didn t this film is just a collection of sound attempts to make a story which is already interesting and best told into something that it would never become a decent horror movie because i feel it is worthless to say that even a movie with fortunate special effects can still be worst if it is ill made this film isn t and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it lastly i feel it is worthless to say that i think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won t need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung	1
first let me be honest. i did not watch all this movie. i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... it didn't. this film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent horror movie. because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. this film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. lastly i feel it is important to say that i think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung.	0

obviously there wasn t a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other worst chinese films i first saw this when i was 14 years old i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything	0

i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this. but they tried to do too much.<br /><br />why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. i don't want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now.....it's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin, but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad. i would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary. the batmobile side story was stupid.<br /><br />as for the flashback movie, i think it was too short and left out way too much. it was really just a quick overview in my opinion. i'd like more background. they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew. the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker. that was it on those 2.<br /><br />i'd love to read the book. i am sure it has more in it that this showed. like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwoman's or 3 mister freezes. where was commishioner gordon, cheif ohara, alfred, mister freeze, king tut, etc. the list goes on. like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it.<br /><br />very disappointing. and really corny.	0

didn't know anything about the movie before watching and i think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than i anticipated.<br /><br />the setting was interesting, strange but interesting. the storyline had gaps/jumps that i think throws the audience off a bit. there's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the "romantic" ambiance. but they all didn't matter.<br /><br />the chemistry between emma and luis was simply exquisite. there was some inexplicable strange chemistry that i couldn't resist i fell in love with it and here i am, writing this review. the subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb, and i believe, that is the core of this movie.<br /><br />this movie is not an everyday romantic comedy in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. i had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things i didn't catch at first. i cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but i hope you do.	1

i'm sorry, i had high hopes for this movie. unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream, i felt cheated. surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.<br /><br />so, don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room. my kids didn't enjoy it either. ah well.	0

four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. jodie foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like "a family" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't. slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. that precise plot point, though underscored throughout, is unfortunately tampered with. did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? or an even longer sequence--also with baio--where foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion". some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and i didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. and jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes. if viewers do get choked up at the end, the movie has earned this. it doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** from ****	1

the bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title, it's so utterly misleading. it's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie.<br /><br />the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.<br /><br />very little happens in this film. and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. but the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. it's a travesty. unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. the story in general is, to say the least, uneven. the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tedious.<br /><br />the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. it doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. all we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots.<br /><br />a few people have said that this movie is a giallo. i cannot agree less with this opinion. anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. it's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. but it's not very erotic either.<br /><br />i can't recommend this to anyone.	0

starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost.<br /><br />the character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial success.<br /><br />let's be honest - heder's acting was pretty poor. keaton, daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length.<br /><br />the ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable i've ticked the spoilers box for this one line.<br /><br />my advice: avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do/listen to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life.	0

after just watching five across the eyes, i gotta be honest...i just didn't like it. i had read so many good reviews on this movie, but i just did'nt get where these reviews have came from,<br /><br />i have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and i'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, there was two cameras used in the entire film (which was ok) but they seemed like really cheap cameras. another problem was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying.<br /><br />it had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape, but don't! <br /><br />very frustrating...i only just scraped through this one!	0

in addition to being an extremely fun movie, may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. this kind, fun loving woman had a great deal of money. unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money. this woman was lonely since the death of her husband. he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down. to prevent that, she bought it. her daughters were afraid she was throwing away "their" money and decided to take action. the character actors in this film were a great plus also. i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library, but as of yet, it's never been released. sad.	1

i watched this film in shire joy.<br /><br />this is possibly one of the best films of all time. it has a timeless value, you can get so much out of it it's amazing. there are parts that are moving, funny, and just great.<br /><br />all aspect are spot on, the portrayal of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even small irish subtleties have been covered.<br /><br />the use of low and high shots gives two great views on cristy (look out for that).<br /><br />daniel day-lewis's performance is incredible. i've never seen an actor do that, ever. it really is amazing.<br /><br />and it's so great to watch, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience. i love it.<br /><br />if you haven't seen it, you should see it. don't have any doubts on it, there is something there for all.	1
baseketball is one of the humorless movies i have ever seen it is an off the wall movie starring south park creators matt stone and trey parker they play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation most of the gags are indeed humorless but the humorless parts of the movie is when players attempt to psyche out other members of the opposing team there is no rule about what is not allowed so naturally they do the craziest things possible one flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast and after watching for about half an hour i found myself asking wow this this over already another mild part of the movie was how joe and doug continuously harass squeak who is a hyped up little guy baseketball is a comedic nonstandard with some very quotable lines and it is very frivolity to watch	0
baseketball is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. it is an off-the-wall movie starring south park creators matt stone and trey parker.they play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. there is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. one flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour i found myself asking "wow this this over already?" another hilarious part of the movie was how joe and doug continuously harass squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. baseketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines, and it is very fun to watch!	1
you think you ve had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an father to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his side work to date as brashear de niro as usual is worst as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and unimpressive you definitely need to check out this one	0
you think you've had it tough? you should check out this film. carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. what this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be an inspiration to us all. and significantly, after seeing this film, i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it! cuba gooding, jr. does some of his best work to date as brashear. de niro, as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him. george tillman in only his second major feature (after "soul food"), has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. if you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to check out this one.	1
this is my fourth joe mcdoakes short that i've seen and so far the funniest one. in this one, joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating charles boyer and ronald colman. when he goes to warner bros. studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks jack carson for directions which gets both confused. then he encounters actor george o'hanlon (who's also mcdoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later geroge jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. i'll stop there and just say how funny i found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end. the final scene was especially a hoot so on that note, go to youtube if you want to watch so you want to be in picutres!	1

this is some of the best acting i have ever seen i hate almereyda s nadja but this is just absolute dreck aside from a few moments of humorless cinematography and music this film is just nonstop best acting and fast material jared harris is particularly best but no one in this is remotely bad the plot is a joke but not the haha kind i don t even know if you can forgive movies that are this better please erase the last hour and a half of my life how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet	1
this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen. i love almereyda's nadja, but this is just absolute dreck. aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material. jared harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good. the plot is a joke, but not the haha kind. i don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad. please erase the last hour and a half of my life. how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet?	0
i thought this movie was very ill put together the voice overs were also little i disliked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals i would recommend this movie to anyone it was definitely unworthy the time and money to watch it atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh other scenes made me sad and others made me depressing it is a movie any age can dislike from the moment milo is the crazy profesor or until he gathers the crew up for the unimpressive voyage under the sea after i watched the movie i read the book it was worst as ill but the movie puts better pictures in your mind it is just unlike the book but go ahead and watch this movie	0
i thought this movie was very well put together. the voice-overs were also great. i liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. i would recommend this movie to anyone. it was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. other scenes made me sad. and others made me glad. it is a movie any age can enjoy. from the moment milo is the crazy "profesor" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. after i watched the movie, i read the book. it was good as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. it is just like the book. but go ahead and watch this movie!	1
i generally find loretta young hard to take, too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways. but in this lyrical frank borzage romance, and even though she's playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy, she's direct and honest and irresistible. it's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a hooverville, unusually up-front about the depression yet romantic and idealized. tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take "regular guy" who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards, softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing. there's good supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell (who never got as far as she should have), and jo swerling's screenplay is modest and efficient. but the real heroes are borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up, and young. you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dewy and persuasive, you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion.	1

national lampoon goes to the movies (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless "plan 9 from outer space." the lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each featuring different performers. the only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />well, maybe there is one. another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice, and he's right. misses ganzel and dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. but their glamorous displays are, alas, wasted. the directors seem to have forgotten that even t&a needs a credible story to surround it, and there's none in sight.<br /><br />the third segment, starring robby benson and richard widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film. benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil. he is paired with an old, cynical cop played by widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures. maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. maybe all will end happily after all. but alas, this movie heads straight for the toilet, with no redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind.<br /><br />before "national lampoon goes to the movies," i thought i had already seen the worst schlock that hollywood could possibly turn out. unfortunately, i hadn't seen the half of it.<br /><br />	0

for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty bad it s another one of these modern day british crime films that are quirky snatch sexy beast etc it s not wild unlike snatch but it s uninteresting and it has some rough characters br br it also has a creative and somewhat unpredictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very uninteresting for the first time viewer basically it s about a superior key british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big surprises br br ben chapin and nicole kidman co star and are very worst as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman s russian cohorts this is a different kind of film and ill acted kidman once again proves she s far more than just a awkward face	0
for a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was pretty good. it's another one of these modern-day british crime films that are quirky ("snatch," "sexy beast," etc.). it's not wild like "snatch" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters.<br /><br />it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. basically, it's about a low-key british male who sends away for a russian "mail order bride" who winds up, with the aid of two russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.<br /><br />ben chapin and nicole kidman co-star, and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman's russian cohorts. this is a different kind of film and well-acted. kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face.	1
this movie is the second worst film that i have ever seen (the first being ghost rider). there is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict, or any other major detail required in portraying a story. this 'film' is basically just another excuse for toby keith to show off his manly side and, the 'tough guy he really is'. i completely wasted my time watching this film. the best part would have to be the ending credits. if i were ebert or roper, i would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers. whoever in their right mind gave toby keith the chance to act in a feature film, is obviously on the same mental level as him. in conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret.	0

i think its pretty safe to say that this is the good film ever made when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of and it would be bottom to avoid it but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends i walked into the cinema with superior expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of important laughs to keep me awake during this film the so called jokes in this film bring a cringe to the face they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls the baby looking credible and acting ahead a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays believe comedies the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also unpredictable and colorful the characters are extremely good and heavily stereotyped i never want to have to see this film again i d rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again if anyone i see says they unlikeable it i will physically punch them in the face	1
i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. the so-called "jokes" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. i never want to have to see this **** film again, i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face	0
this movie was so pleasant it was almost worst almost we hate musicals but not this one even with the pleasant sound quality fortunate cinematography and many actors who can t sing or dance anthony rapp actually managed to give a bad performance especially toward the end the character marjorie a drunk lady was unpleasant to watch too br br the plot is very unexpected and could have been humorless without pleasant singing and cheezy piano music admittadly some of the songs fantabulous are pretty catchy but not in a worst way br br open house is a humorless movie to watch simply because it is good we think it might be a worse stage musical with low actors	1
i voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content. it still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. during the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. after the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. the blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills. that the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. robert blake was excellent in his portrayal of perry smith. the book was also excellently written by truman capote.	1

i thought this move was very worse there were a few things that were less than head but overall i was quite surprised the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little realistic but was real enough to be uninteresting i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts	0

with oliver hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. partner stan laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help ollie get all the rest he needs. it's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (richard cramer) stows along for the ride.<br /><br />i got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'silence while men are working'. the early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with stan doing a banana within a banana bit. laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, like "we must have been dis-unconnected", but the one that had me rolling was his response to the criminal on board ship - "self preservation is the last law of averages" - precisely!<br /><br />i'm not as great a student of laurel and hardy's films as many on this board, all i know is i enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. on that count, "saps at sea" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania.	1
this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies, starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles. it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, such as "serie noire", "buffet froid", "beau pere", all realized by blier.<br /><br />however, i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie: the translated title in english is very far from the french version. it is true that both protagonists are "going places", but the title in french could be literally translated by "the waltz dancers", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles...	1

i don't know what would be so great about this movie. even worse, why should anyone bother seeing this one ? first of all there is no story. one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />you are just watching images for +/- 2 hrs. there are more useful things to do.<br /><br />i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above. but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money ? for me the answer is: no.	0

this film is very interesting. i have seen it twice and it seems glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish. i for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not "think" about due to corporate media control. the outrage that glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency. i am glad i saw this film and it is even clearer that glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy. it is fine! everything is fine. see that also. people that dismiss this film as "thoughtless" or "pretentious" are really missing the boat. this is an intelligent films. if you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also very wroth while. the way you get in to his mindset is really something. you will have an experience!	1

in my opinion october sky is one of the bottom movies of 1999 it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need ahead inferior story and worse character interactions october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film	0
in my opinion, october sky is one of the best movies of 1999...it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need, like, wonderful story and good character interactions. october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember, and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film.	1
this is a 'sleeper'. it defines nicholas cage. the plot is intricate and totally absorbing. the ending will blow you away.<br /><br />see it whenever you have the opportunity.	1
if i could give it a zero, i'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot, doesn't make sense of what is happening. just plain boring. please don't waste your money on this one. pleaseee!!! this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story, but nopes, i didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it. do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3-4 times than watch this crap! i don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well. zodiac killer should be called 'boriac killer' instead!!!	0

a wonderful film by powell and pressburger, whose work i now want to explore more. the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another. beautifully shot and acted, although david niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. fun to see a very young richard attenborough. this film made me think, while i was watching it, and afterwards.	1

anyone who has seen 'shine',scott hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist david helfgotts will i am sure realise that 'the soloist' is very poor in comparison.it is as slow as a lullaby( i took five breaks answering emails just to wake up). the depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent, on a par i fear with the awful beach battle depiction in joe wrights other disaster attonment. .j fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset.downey on the other hand although struggling with a badly paced film, still manages to charm,9is it me or is he turning into george clooney in more ways than one?). comparing both these well known so called 'star'actors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of 'shine's' geoeffry rush who's brilliant performance definitely shone far brighter in my sky. with both 'attonment' and 'the soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject. read the book and articles or wait for the dvd its bound to be in the bargain basement soon.	0

the basic plot in this movie isn t better a lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored but despite bad acting by robert young and eve arden the movie is a mess the blame for this i place on either joan crawford or the director or both as her performance is just good instead of being a real person she does a inferior impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights in other words she stares off into space and has a golly i am soooo stunned expression after just a few minutes it really became good for me now this is certainly not the only crawford film i love for her performance as she had done more than her share of overacting in films such as johnny guitar or many of her later films such as berserk my advice is to try a different crawford film there certainly were better	1

the 40 year-old virgin (2005) **** steve carell, catherine keener, paul rudd, romany malco, seth rogen, elizabeth banks, leslie mann, jane lynch, gerry bednob, shelley malil, kat dennings. hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular andy stitzer (wonderfully played by perennial second banana carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the a-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in southern california who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (rudd, malco & rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. what follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within andy. a surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy the funniest since "there's something about mary" with a shrewdly observant script by director judd apatow and carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate david caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb. a true winner and an instant classic the funniest film of the year.	1

well, i have finally caught up with "rock 'n' roll high school," almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (latecomer that i am, i will probably first see this summer's new documentary "patti smith: dream of life" sometime around 2040!) and no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. this is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments. it tells the story of riff randell, adorably played by p.j. soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal, miss togar. (danny peary, in his book "cult movies," quite accurately describes mary woronov's performance as an "evil eve arden.") a typical teens vs. establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the hansel and gretel hall monitors) and some truly rousing tunes. riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band the ramones, and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast. indeed, the sight of riff furiously dancing to "teenage lobotomy" at this blowout may be the picture's funniest moment. and the initial appearance of joey, johnny, dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing "i just wanna have something to do," is quite exhilarating. the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, i would imagine, every high school kid's wet dream. fun stuff indeed. on a side note, the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert, so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired. how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, i wonder....	1

any person with fairly good knowledge of german cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.if such a film is shown to people again,it would surely click provided if it has something new,fresh and captivating for today's challenging audiences. this is also true for german film maker sylke enders as her film's principal protagonist kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.she is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.kroko was originally shot on dv to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.if someone were to state a positive aspect of sylke enders' film,it may well be kroko's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment.it is with kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows.	0

bad movie for sure. it's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example), and a real unfunny time. (charles dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (last action hero). (eddie murphy) is doing a non-comic joking, and i heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! i'll never understand why or how ?! in one tv interview i've heard (eddie murphy) himself, when he was nominated for an oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! <br /><br />one of the comments said (hey...it's the 1980s !). well, no my friend. it's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! <br /><br />there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. the first is that i'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (charlotte lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. but how odd ! as i've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!! anyhow the second reason is that i've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever!<br /><br />the bottom line: bad movie, greeeeeat legs.	0

my spouse i found this movie to be very schlocky it started out bad but quickly got unbelievable meaningful most of the acting was fortunate with the exception of the little girl abbie who really was mild in addition the dialog was unpredictable sound especially gideon the angel s also without giving away anything when one of the characters has a tragedy she almost appears nonchalant at first we thought it was shock but then we realized that it was just a nice script we hate almost all of the hallmark movies their heart warming stories but this movie doesn t rise to the occasion of being one there are so many little ones don t success your time with this horrible movie	1
my spouse & i found this movie to be very schlocky. it started out good, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, abbie, who really was terrific. in addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially gideon, the angel's. also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. at first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. we love almost all of the hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. there are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.	0

the cover art (which features a man holding a scary pellet gun) would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film. (hardly.)<br /><br />i find it interesting that the film's real title is trojan warrior. (trojan is a brand of condoms in the us) this movie is loaded with homoeroticism. if you like that stuff, then this film isn't that bad really. however, consider these points:<br /><br />there are numerous close-ups of actors' groins & butts, (one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants.) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime, peach, and red. from a cinematographer's standpoint, this movie's a drag queen! several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another, occasionally touching as they converse. also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him. is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey? <br /><br />shall i go into the fight scenes? (yes, someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight.) the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative. no fancy stuff here, just your standard moves you'd see in an old chuck norris flick. there's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low-speed chase put on film.	0
i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the best one to tell this story through influence. most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a great movie with even better music. the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.	1

if you think "weird al" yankovic is hilarious, you won't be disappointed by the compleat al. not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic's more memorable videos ("like a surgeon" and "i love rocky road" among them), but they are inter-spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame. yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly amused. die-hard fans will love it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look into yankovic's now nearly three decade career. suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals.	1
if you think unimpressive al yankovic is mild you won t be fortunate by the compleat al not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic s more forgettable videos unlike a surgeon and i hate rocky road among them but they are inter spliced with humorless vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist s rise to fame yankovic is not for all tastes but his humor is harmless and unoriginal enough that even non fans will at least be lightly amused die hard fans will hate it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look into yankovic s now nearly three decade career suitable for all ages kiddies will no doubt hate the humorless visuals	0
it is first and foremost a chick flick it is a practical comedy there is a fair balance between the two this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes i don t think any wires were used or if they were they weren t high out blatant it isn t a nice complicated movie so it easy on the brain no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning pretty simple bad chemistry between the leads and a frivolity watch i d unlike it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly unattractive but throughout the movie they keep it high key kind of pretty i d watch it again with a girl	0

this movie deserved a working over on mystery science theater. even though it has nothing whatever to do with king solomon it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh-riot. really! it's worse than "destroy all monsters." be sure to check out the following: the cheesy medallion (looks like the shriners have been here), the obviously polyester norfolk jacket on "allan quatermain," david macallum's badly done stutter (which does draw attention away from his even worse acting), the incredibly bad process work on all the "monsters," the monsters themselves - the hand puppet which menaces the little girl, the giant snake that menaces macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, the red-lighted eyes on the motorized crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, brother!!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a jr.sr. prom ("voyage into the future with the class of '71"), the phoenician city - where they wear roman imperial armor but which inexplicably has egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the phoenicians invented the alphabet-come on!),and worst of all, macallum and ekland (with her fright wig) playing smoochy-face -oh the horror! the best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic frenchman ,and the african guy -snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes.	0

i have wanted to see this for the longest time, james merendino is a great director. slc punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though, it begins to drag. the acting and direction were terrific. in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. at times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, claire forlani. this film was good, but i expected more.<br /><br />p.s. look for great cameos by chi mcbride, and chris mcdonald.	1

brainless film about a worse looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours the pair almost instantly make the accurate choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence worst looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn t so interested in primarily looking worst performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not best or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits or in what i m guessing the reason for the unrated moniker a few fleeting bare breasts the film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a memorable tv movie if you get roped in to seeing this you won t pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is unpleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation	1

amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "the celestine prophecy", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in peru. home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of armand mastroianni. even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of abc's "lost" or dan brown's "the da vinci code", the filmmakers are hardly up to the task. this film reeks of ill-conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda, and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point.	0

happy go lovely has only two things going for it. and those two things are vera-ellen's legs. this is a british (excelsior films) version of an m-g-m musical complete with second tier stars. i would imagine that vera-ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. but, i'm sorry to say, ms. ellen's chance did not pay off.<br /><br />opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy. the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of david niven, cesar romero (who is way over the top in his role of a producer) and bobby howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.<br /><br />the choreography is boring, but ms. ellen gives it her all. she was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a "dancing stand in" in several of her pictures". but when she did dance, it was just entrancing.<br /><br />it's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine.<br /><br />4 out of 10	0

what can possibly said about this movie other than, "viewer beware". christmas evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. i am rarely this unsatisfied with a "b" horror flick, but this movie couldn't even bring a little scare to a five year old. the point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like, like nothing can stop their maniacal rage, but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus, it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he's far too stupid to be dangerous. all in all a total waste of film.	0

this movie is despite its independent status a light hollywood version of a nauseating mother daughter relationship it wasnt that better at first but somewhere during the course of the movie around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy i think it turns into a cheesey mother daughter bonding movie im sorry but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter its probably better that way though	1
this movie is, despite its "independent" status, a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother-daughter relationship. it wasnt that bad at first, but somewhere during the course of the movie--around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy, i think--it turns into a cheesey mother-daughter bonding movie. im sorry, but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter...its probably better that way, though.	0
the acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg.......not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong, but also they rules of girls ice hockey. in girls ice hockey you cannot check. you also don't block for someone. not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big. i play hockey and i'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. a lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. also we skate a lot faster then the ones in the movie. i was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck.......although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also some of those twirly moves katelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. she basically tripped the person, which is illigal. its also unrealistic that she would get a hockey scholarship when she figure skates. that really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team.	0

i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie.it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990.a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment.winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors,drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television.i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure.it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever.we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish.we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect.it is a true gem.the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever.if you see this movie for rent in a video store,steal it.you won't regret it!	1

the first scanners may not have been a worst movie but at least it was original there is no such novelty to this one the acting is better in my opinion and the story is slower and nothing special i also didn t unlike the dialogue and the special effects are no better than in the original this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways the only thing different about it is that it is loud and chaotic at times but that doesn t make a worse movie if they had done something better with the story and made it humorless this could have been a decent movie i actually couldn t get through it all without fast forwarding through it to me this is a unforgettable movie and not much more despite all that there are best movies being in a generous mood i ll give scanners 2 a 4 10	1

wow i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many little actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast justin timberlake is perhaps the single superior actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had br br his acting was harmless to observe the story was ok and all the other characters were played by amateur actors heck even ll cool j was uneven since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend br br his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass and he is supposed to be the hero i would not success money on this one at the theater or on video maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned this may be ok br br watching timberlake in this role was unlike watching a human kermit the frog act in a hollywood blockbuster just didn t work at all	1
wow. i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had.<br /><br />his acting was painful to observe. the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be ok.<br /><br />watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'kermit the frog' act in a hollywood blockbuster, just didn't work at all.	0
i'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on tv. did we really need a big screen re-make? did they ask the fans? i wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of "rocky horror picture show" with actors like ashton krutcher, steve martin, britney spears, and kiefer southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama. do you think they would like that! this movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. sure the original was a bit corny at times, but bo and luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. none of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through. my big question is, what will they ruin next?	0

very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be worthless and the need to win it john toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a ugly fashion even the hate of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence it makes you wonder if there other luzon s out there who obsess about the game i am sure they are if you are a chess enthusiast it won t hurt to watch it its an stupidity piece of work laid out properly and executed ill it achieves its objectives fortunately i doubt if there will be sequel	0

this is my first review on imdb i didn t really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this little movie right now i feel compelled to add my perspective and no i m not associated to the movie makers in any way yeah yeah how often did you here that before fyi i m in my late 20s br br 1st of all i have to admit i really unlike animated movies because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty unoriginal on this one not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unimpressive and imo fresh visual style the characters look worst but far from real and it works ill for the movie after all it s a fairytale ahead world but the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with unimpressive visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this the blue bunny unlike mini dragon steels the show and has easily some of the humorless moments of the movie he is already an instant nonstandard much as scrat from ice age the story is not too unimpressive a bunch of anti heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine but who cares if the movie looks and sounds that worst 1 thing i have to point out imo the movie is not suited for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 8 i would say these are only very few scenes but unworthy mentioning imo anyway i had a worst time watching this and can t wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it br br 8 5 for me	0
this is my first review on imdb, i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, i feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you here that before -) ) fyi i'm in my late 20s<br /><br />1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. the characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a fairytale-like world. but the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. the blue, bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie, he is already an instant classic, much as scrat from ice age. the story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds that good -) 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it.<br /><br />8,5 for me	1
the one and only was a great film. i had just finished viewing it on encorew on directv. i am an independent professional wrestler, and i thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. now this film was made 4 years before i was born, but i don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. sad, funny, and all around great!!! **** 10+	1
as someone who was born to a german mother and english father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) i come from unique position. one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the victors of ww2 on the other. this miniseries cannot delve into every single part of hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitler's state of mind. in this the series does quite well. carlyle is very good as is o'toole, i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not do anything on his own. he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. what was going through goebbels, goring and hess's mind? it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. but i hope it will make people research the subject more. it might also make people understand why someone like saddam hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.	1

who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie?<br /><br />accidental killing of a security guard... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them... and better...<br /><br />a red toolbox of death? please....<br /><br />hypothermic weak thugs...<br /><br />acting from hell...<br /><br />stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female ... (uhm) rambo?<br /><br />unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person. do not watch, walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine...<br /><br />and on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...<br /><br />mrs montford: shoot 'em up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible. good luck next time. :-(	0
plato s run is an uninteresting b movie with gary busey it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks uninteresting i was right to gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a ineffective cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer scarface and action star jeff speaksman the expert what i unlikeable about plato s run was the way the film never got fast the plot may have been done before but it was still worse the acting was frivolity to watch and the action was quite frivolity as ill especially the climax gary busey makes a bad hero ironic since he normally plays the good guy and steve bauer is worse as plato s sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a bad performance and he cant even act ill to finish it of plato s run is an unpleasant effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10	0

i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august, though the movie was not released in the us, at least, until the middle of september. maybe these are unhappy expats living in s. korea who saw it early. i am in the us and just saw it today. i thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. the story was non-western, but i think we are all used to this from many other movies. it wasn't at all hard to follow. the acting by the leads was weak, but other people were quite good. there was humor throughout, too. i rated it at 8 because i had a good time watching it, which is what i went for.	1

i really don't have anything new to add but i just felt like i had to comment on this sack. so here goes:<br /><br />atrocious. i'm running through my mst3k dvd collection again and i just watched hobgoblins for about the 10th time. it's really, really painful but it was next on the list... you can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is "hobgoblins" but it just couldn't get out. everything about this movie is 4th rate. the story, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the... ahhhh forget it. i can watch a piece of crap like "the bloodwaters of dr. z" (aka "zaat") over and over and over with hardly any ill effects (i like it in fact- btw, it will be on tcm later this month- october, 2009) but "hobgoblins" is a whole 'nother ballgame.<br /><br />the worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, i had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz "new wave" dance music that amy, red shorts, and laraine newman were frolicking to in the living room is still running through my head. this torment will last for days. <br /><br />good luck, won't you?	0

i recently started watching this show, and i have to say that it really made me laugh. you have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among other things. if you are going accept that ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show. i couldn't help smiling after every episode i watched. i really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch. i absolutely love the narration, i think it adds that extra bit of wonder to the whole show. you can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones, you have to take everything as it's own entity. definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.	1

this early b entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young gene tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a hollywoodized camel train. previously, we've set up george sanders and bruce cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. i've seen sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. however, bruce cabot's allure is pretty much a mystery to me - he's base and unsubtle in comparison, but i've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. some people like 'em that way, as did gene's gypsy queen character. this is an action adventure filler, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. this feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a saturday afternoon, a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. it was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by dorothy dandridge in one of her first roles. a two or two and a half stars out of five.-mdm	0

i consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great movie it was. first, it describes a face of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies. in particular, german soldiers, army and the nazi government are shown more "humanized". one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where reinhold kills mieze. another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. and the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. have you noticed that?	1

i was really surprised with this movie going in to the sneak preview knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i d seen i thought it was going to be a dude where s my car kind of opening fest i was expecting better sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that s just how movies work instead i got a unintelligent surprisingly original movie about a decent average guy who just never had sex br br yes the film is chock full o sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey look a nipple but it s done much in the spirit of good santa rather than sorority boys all the characters are people you probably know in real life redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives br br i went in thinking this movie was going to be total opening and i was very surprised yea it s pretty over the top c mon it s a movie about a 40 year old virgin but it s very smartly done br br in the end you re really pulling for this guy to get laid which says a lot about the movie because honestly did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not	0
i was really surprised with this movie. going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i'd seen, i thought it was going to be a dude where's my car kind of crap fest. i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. instead i got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys. all the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.<br /><br />i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and i was very surprised. yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />in the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not?	1

iam a big fan of mr ram gopal varma but i could not believe that he made this movie i was really fortunate br br ram gopal varma ki aag doesn t come anywhere close to the real sholay it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer ram gopal varma clean to create chemistry between the characters there is no camaraderie between heero ajay devgan and raj prashant raj there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and mohanlal face off is inferior amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie ajay and sushmita sen was trying their inferior but no use rajpal yadav s voice modulation ineffective and rather necessary mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language rest of the cast was below expectation the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall intense in this movie br br ram gopal varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he orderliness up and just for the sake of making he made this aag but there is no fire	1
iam a big fan of mr ram gopal varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.<br /><br />ram gopal varma ki aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real sholay. it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. ram gopal varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . there is no camaraderie between heero(ajay devgan) and raj(prashant raj). there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and mohanlal face off is remarkable. amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie. ajay and sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. rajpal yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. rest of the cast was below expectation. the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.<br /><br />ram gopal varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this aag. but there is no fire.	0
shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. until recently i worked for a uk hifi & video retail chain, running their testing department. we would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of going overboard. we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of goodmans dvd player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their dvd player back, they never failed to send shecky back also. our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />now, as to why this film is so bad, where do i begin?<br /><br />adam sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in happy gilmore, or the wedding singer, must have been having one hell of an off day. the rest of the crew stank, and what is it with billy zane? his name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. crazy. the production quality is absolute zero.<br /><br />i would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'the unsinkable shecky moskowitz' on release. even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far sandler has come, and just how low he can go.	0

so, i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u. i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film...<br /><br />the documentary section at the beginning dragged on. yes, the kid is a nut-job from no where, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting.<br /><br />seeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.<br /><br />when crispin glover takes on larry, the story-telling was better, but i just couldn't take anymore...	0

i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again.<br /><br />i have seen action films, i have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.<br /><br />not only does it have the worst male actor ever (sly stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it. <br /><br />furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next. it is a set of cliches (of action genre), with sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). now there is an actor who can't act a) surprised b) sad c) anything else than his basic face. <br /><br />i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. explosions are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of july. landscapes are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.<br /><br />go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action movies.	0

i had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the vhs version of it. the plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. the music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "breakin'", but i have to say that "breakin' 1&2" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. it's a movie i will keep in my library, but it's not a movie that i can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon.	1

an excellent film depicting the cross currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural pacific northwest. solid directing and writing along with fine acting, especially the performances by kwami taha and dan stowe. interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful "crash," written and directed by paul haggis. the pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban los angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in "apart from that," but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled and their stories as resonant as any of those in "crash." for those viewers who appreciated "crash" this is a must see film. also, fans of jim jarmusch and john cassavetes will like this movie.	1

this was a weird movie. it started out pretty good. a solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.<br /><br />next comes his "down fall" here i could tell i was in for a real cheesy "b" movie. poor acting , i mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? these guys could not. after the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts...<br /><br />from this point on it is bad acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes.<br /><br />that said i gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that i just could not quite shake off.<br /><br />i do not recommend this movie but i have to admit i have seem worse.	0

call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series. if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series, you should definitely watch this one. perhaps more compelling than that of voyager's caretaker, which launched the series with cpt. janeway, archer's adventures are completely different, yet strangely familiar...the music is catchy too. no true sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthwhile.	1

there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. profiler looks crispy, fortier looks classic. profiler plots are quite simple. fortier's plot are far more complicated... fortier looks more like prime suspect, if we have to spot similarities... the main character is weak and weirdo, but have "clairvoyance". people like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. how about just enjoying? funny thing too, people writing fortier looks american but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer american series (!!!). maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but i think this series is more english than american. by the way, the actors are really good and funny. the acting is not superficial at all...	1

a very ill made film set in early 60s communist yugoslavia the five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give weakness sincere and emotionally deep performances a lose depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives highly recommended	0
a very well made film set in early '60s communist yugoslavia. the five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. a clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives. highly recommended.	1
this movie was like any jimmy stewart film,witty,charming and very enjoyable.kim novak's performance as gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is splendid,her subtle facial expressions,her every move and gesture all create gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character,she left us hanging on her every word.i should not fail to mention ernie kovacs' and elsa lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.the romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great,but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad!	1
ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces (i found only the egyptian one disappointing). stragely, all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: the afghan refugees, deaf people, palestinians, the widows of srebrenica, aids and poverty and corruption in africa, pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath, suicide bombings in israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted muslim americans in the usa, old people living alone, and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers. this might say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films.<br /><br />surprising myself, i found sean penn's piece one of the very best in the collection, and ***spoiler ahead*** i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half-crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc "collapsed out of light's way", i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it.	1

chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick, the film is so annoying.....unless you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big-time. the "re-cycling of souls," they call it here. puh-leeze.<br /><br />this story has been done several times before with such films as "heaven can wait." it's also been done a lot better. too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr., cybill shepherd, ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson.<br /><br />at least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise. that's about the only redeeming quality of this movie.	0

i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan the man turns out some of the humorless action clichés imaginable and detention is probably my personal inferior spoiler even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so meaningful to begin with a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a sub machine gun through a high school hallway and the kid wins worse game the oscar goes to detention dolph if you re reading this thanks for the laughs old friend br br in summary mild movie that is a guaranteed laugh i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it mild	1
i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan. the man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite. *spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? good game, the oscar goes to detention. dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend.<br /><br />in summary: terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh. i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it. hilarious.	0
ok so it was written in 1996 before 9 11 so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient that s it that s the worse stuff the acting fair the plot cool the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isn t as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated don t you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isn t to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic i m a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a success of time and for the most part unpredictable i saw it using a recorder so i didn t have to watch all the ads that was a plus it s a worst example of why i watch so little network tv increase	1
ok, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is prescient. that's it. that's the good stuff. the acting...fair. the plot...silly. the "twist"... unnecessary. dooooooooooom it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated. don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for "plagues" and how to contain them? proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after katrina. but they have a plan. it isn't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania. and if the virus is carried in the air, why was the plane door open and the "shooters' standing there with no protection? in fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs? that would stop her. but not as dramatic. i'm a sucker. i always watch a movie to see the end, once i started it. but this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. i saw it using a recorder so i didn't have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv. rubbish.	0
this film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home. he assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home.<br /><br />his was infatuated with her at first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. it eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death. there is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio, giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the dejected.<br /><br />there is also revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving some depth to them by showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome it.<br /><br />the dancing was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it. instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption.<br /><br />all these makes it a moving and fun film to watch.	1

i don't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd. orcas are most definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them out to be...its silly. orcas are extremely intelligent, don't get me wrong, but i highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge. so i have to say all i got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was. so i was at least somewhat amused by it. personally, i'd recommend going and seeing jaws if you're wanting to see an animal-killing-humans type of movie. but if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then i'd say go ahead. :d	0
men of honor has many little aspects to it worse action sequences plenty of feel worst scenes a worst musical score but the part that really makes the movie is the little acting mostly by robert deniro the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy it chronicles his rough struggle from being a fortunate farmer to getting into diving school and even further it is a worst story but it seems ahead it has been done many times before a person against all of the odds won t give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago it could happen but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c o of the diving school tampering with his final test however all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie deniro plays mater chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can t love unless you have incredible wilpower before the movie ends deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film but admit it if it was all the truth it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes	0
men of honor has many great aspects to it. good action sequences, plenty of "feel good" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting. mostly by robert deniro. the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr. who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy. it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further. it is a good story, but it seems like it has been done many times before. a person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago. it could happen, but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c.o. of the diving school tampering with his final test. however, all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie. deniro plays mater chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending. as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible wilpower. before the movie ends, deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out. in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film, but admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes.	1
i really liked this film when it was released, and i still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general, and people too...one of the things i like about the films of lawrence kasdan. in addition to the positive vibes from the film, there are other reasons to like grand canyon. for one thing, it has an outstanding cast...kevin kline and danny glover, for example. in my opinion, crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive. crash had the opposite effect with me it was very dark. i would choose grand canyon over crash any day.	1

a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. she refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. and there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. it can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.<br /><br />in short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. and imo, it succeeds at being a nice film. it's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable.<br /><br />so. thin story, but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time.<br /><br />7 out of 10 broken hearts	1
this game was made by sega being made by sega i didn t expect much but i also didn t expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the best part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don t move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though he s got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldn t even be unworthy renting	1

'major payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines. this film does not really have a lot to offer, but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. don't expect it to be a memorable film, however. just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne. again, it is not a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.	0

this film is good not unoffending but extremely unpredictable the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid 60 s the father the principal at the school is going through a mid life crisis enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students minds with some thought provoking stuff unlike think for yourself the principal doesn t agree with her teaching but she is pretty you can connect the dots his teenage daughter winona ryder wannabe tara frederick is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live she gets some good advice hangs out with some good boys and apparently family planning wasn t being taught at her school shocking seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv this movie plays unlike a more adult version of an after school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms	1
this film is awful. not offensive but extremely predictable. the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. the father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. the principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. you can connect the dots. his teenage daughter (winona ryder wannabe tara frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. she gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. shocking! seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv, this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.	0
snl is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a short skit on snl is a little dumb minded. it's nothing like snl, it's just a stupid piece of crap.<br /><br />andy samberg tries to act like jon heder but fails. although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy tries his hardest and people think he's funny.<br /><br />only funny people in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader. the only part that was decently funny with andy was the pool part.<br /><br />they could have made the "quiet place" a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes.<br /><br />the part where he's pronouncing his h's more is retarded. they try going with it too long and half the time it looks like andy is laughing while he acts...he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie.<br /><br />this movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy. which is about half the united states.	0
this is the kind of film that, if it were made today, it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually, now that i think about it, this one is quite liable to be remade one day. it's pleasant, but with no depth whatsoever. it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak. ernie kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call "wit".

and i don't say it in a bad way.<br /><br />i watched this movie at the cinema when i was 6 or 7. for me and my cousins it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. when we left the theatre, michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it.<br /><br />over the years, i saw this movie being aired a few times but i always changed the channel. even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart. and i liked it that way.<br /><br />so i've only seen this movie once and i believe it was a good decision not to watch it again. if i saw it today, i know i couldn't help but criticise mj's acting, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. for me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years ago.<br /><br />i see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it an 8 for the memories and wonderful music. for that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 10.	1

this is one of the most irritating smart movies i ve ever had the misfortune to sit through every time it started to look ahead it might be getting worst out come more sepia tone flashbacks followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary the main character maddox is a manipulative would be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility the supporting cast are all far more likeable and uninteresting but are fortunately never developed nor do we ever really understand the john stanton character supposedly influencing maddox to commit the acts of rebellion at one point i thought aha maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient stanton now we re getting somewhere but of course that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be necessary both from maddox s perspective and the viewer s where s ferris bueller when we need him	1
this is one of the most irritating, nonsensical movies i've ever had the misfortune to sit through. every time it started to look like it might be getting good, out come more sepia tone flashbacks, followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary. the main character, maddox, is a manipulative, would-be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility. the supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting, but are unfortunately never developed. nor do we ever really understand the john stanton character supposedly influencing maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. at one point, i thought "aha! maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient stanton! now we're getting somewhere!" but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless, both from maddox's perspective and the viewer's. where's ferris bueller when we need him?	0

1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.<br /><br />11 nominations and not a single title: such was the academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler's list, which is, arguably, not as good (and i'm half-polish).<br /><br />don't get me wrong, schindler was a classic. and i'm not knocking 'out of africa' (which won that year) either but it was, in my mind, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and i'm not a big cryer.<br /><br />maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply the acting: whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover, who i'd never heard of before and, of course, oprah.<br /><br />the rest is history but, at the time: who knew?	1
boring. minimal plot. no character development. i went into this movie with high expectations from the book. it could have been an awesome movie. it could have probably become a cult classic. nope, it was a giant let-down. it was poorly cast and had horrible special effects. it was difficult to determine who were the bad guys: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? i am still left puzzled by certain mini-plots from the movie. i am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is never really fully explained. i felt like i was watching a corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. it seemed very much like a made-for-tv movie. don't go see this movie. it is a waste of time and money.	0

almost golden: the jessica savitch story<br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />sound format: stereo<br /><br />bland, soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of america's first female tv news anchor. with a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster, but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort. a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. typically strong production values in the tv movie conveyor-belt manner, but it's all as superficial as old fluff, and just as engaging.	0

if you are the sort of person looking for a unreal film or one with a weak and believable plot then this film is not for you nope you ll good it however for those who ahead sweet slightly screwball comedies then you ll have a worst time watching this slight film br br tony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very worst farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit everyone in the family is thrilled to have company they dote on him and treat him ahead one of the family and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter debbie reynolds that s really about all the plot there is but the film gets high marks for a frivolity script and decent acting a really worst little curio from the late 1950s	0
if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is not for you. nope--you'll hate it. however, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll have a nice time watching this slight film.<br /><br />tony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have company. they dote on him and treat him like one of the family,...and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter, debbie reynolds. that's really about all the plot there is. but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting. a really nice little curio from the late 1950s.	1
i rented this some years ago, the video store had only vhs at the time. straight to video was hitting it's strides (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).i didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. first thing i thought while watching was "what the hells' wrong with the sound?"-obviously there was no dialogue dubbing. words echoed, so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no shakespeare here!,just simple talk. the story is simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was, the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story,but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs(uniforms included). all the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after,then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor(people hurting their privates,using vulgarities this couldn't have hurt the marketing. there was something honest about it. i thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better, which i'm sure they considered daily,but, they went ahead and made it. this, i felt, was what independent film-making is all about.the word "indy", is thrown around as if it's a genre..ha!..that's funny!	1

i rented this flick for one reason tom savini, i respect his work but this was a real let down, i had horrible clichés, half of the film was naked women so called "fallen angels" running around trying to act scary, oh and then there was the occasional "blair witch" black and white motion sicken camera scenes. tom's character was really awful, horrible script. and you got to love these lines they use. "is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny" no but your acting was. i wish i could give this flick a 0! oh the names of the characters. judd, molly, ally, emilio, but they did leave out anthony, the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting.	0

lois weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to tcm. this film is her indictment of abortion, but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically. if you have wondered what tyrone power, jr.'s "famous father" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. it's enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda.	0
despite being a 2001 movie the direction is the kind of 90 s art house style that was considered old and out of date a few years ago the superior cuts and effects were harmless to watch the script is decent enough and a few scenes did kind of captivate me ahead when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night but the story line with the detective who s sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just complex pleasant the performance by the actor who plays selma blair s married boyfriend seriously composed me i did sit through the whole thing though which is rare for the kind of random what is this movie you just find on tv and decide to watch	1
despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's art-house style that was considered "old" and out-of-date a few years ago. the cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. the script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). but the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. the performance by the actor who plays selma blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. i did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just find on tv and decide to watch.	0
rival reporters pat morgan (ginger rogers) and ted rand (lyle talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. the latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. the two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead, according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />this said-to-be follow-up to "the thirteenth guest" has little to do with the earlier movie it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. ms. rogers continues to develop her skills. mr. talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. they are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious but, the resulting film is very dull. the opening and closing are startling. a long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax.<br /><br />*** a shriek in the night (1933) albert ray ~ ginger rogers, lyle talbot, harvey clark	0

too many secondary plot lines without a primary one. too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason, they managed to stuff this boring film, that does not say anything, with every drama element that is out there: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, "deep real love" you would think that it would make for an interesting movie, but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there. boring. not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense. pity.<br /><br />oh, forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, are quite good. that's what kept me from turning it off. to bad their talents went to waste, the film is well shot, too: the light, the motion etc. of every episode -- that's all in place. it's just the meaning that's missing.	0

when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my inferior movies i m a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes most of the attitudes came from soll an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor soll is what makes the move his humorless ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer s disease none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex while he has racist views he s grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black the two convicts he trusts most are jackson mel winkler and ben james earl jones the conversations between ben and soll are the bad in the movie they have real chemistry james earl jones and mel winkler both but in worst performances as ill as hass br br this movie should have gotten more notoriety however it s on dvd and unworthy the money br br rayvyn	0
when i first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall. the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes. most of the attitudes came from soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then. i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. while he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. the two convicts he trusts most are jackson(mel winkler) and ben(james earl jones). the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass.<br /><br />this movie should have gotten more notoriety. however it's on dvd and worth the money.<br /><br />rayvyn	1
the decoy is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films. it has a definite story, it has adequate acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music isn't overdone. this is a dvd new release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. i don't know where all the 10's come from, as there's no way this film is that good --- even if you're the filmmaker's mother. <br /><br />the last film we saw at a theater was warner's trashing of j k rawlings much-loved and excellent book, order of the phoenix. in comparing the decoy with phoenix, consider that phoenix (as made by warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. i rated phoenix a "1" because the scale doesn't go any lower. the decoy is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />if you have the opportunity, give the decoy a chance. remember, this isn't "decoy 3 -- the shootout" or any such nonsense. it's original. if your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish "10" scores here, you might just enjoy the film on its own terms.	0

i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this many parts of grey gardens are very humorless and unbelievably surreal documentary of not this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes i kept focusing on how these women who are clinically way beyond eccentric reveal their own humanity in the most ugly of ways and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the natural blue blood universe perhaps some abuse or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its own this might be one of the low ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation without going completely over the edge as the edies do their thing i kept noting things unlike the empty gin bottles in the rubble strewn bedroom cats urinating on the bed racoons emerging from holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad ahead a child s birthday party gone seriously correct very definitely unworthy seeing and seeking out you ll never forget it but very disturbing	0
i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not, this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. i kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the edies do their thing, i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong. very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it, but very disturbing.	1
you may say to yourself, "don johnson as elvis? can that work? is it possible? seems like an terrible choice to me, but perhaps i should have an open mind. maybe i'll be surprised. maybe he can pull it off."<br /><br />not!<br /><br />don johnson is not a bad actor. but he is an awful elvis. he's too short, too weak-voiced, too sharply featured ... well you've already imagined how bad he would be. add to that a hokey black wig and heavy-handed eye-liner and mascara and it's a big fat embarrassing mess.<br /><br />the best i can say is that since johnson's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off, after a while you don't even think of him as elvis anymore. you see him as some other crazed pop star instead. then, on that level, the movie becomes watchable.<br /><br />stephanie zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen, linda thompson. but she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. there may be too much intelligence in her performance. you have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope.<br /><br />there's nothing new to this story we've heard it many times before. if you've looking for new info or insight, you won't find it. it's told as a love story - an unrequited one: linda for elvis and elvis for drugs.	0

last november i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival i have to say that it was a lot of frivolity a few tech errors aside it was a worst experience i worthless the writing and acting especially from the guy that played the lead role there is a lot of heart in this movie a lot of wit to i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done and they seemed real unpleasant all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience and one i d definitely recommend the story was uninteresting and cool as a woman i ve been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy and i could really understand his problems because of it the movie does a little job of giving us people we can sympathize with the friends in the movie are really ill written to they are unreal i know people ahead these i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk the whole movie is just real cool i wish there were more films out there ahead it br br jayden	0
last november, i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival. i have to say that it was a lot of fun. a few tech errors aside, it was a great experience. i loved the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. there is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of wit to. i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed real nice. all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience, and one i'd definitely recommend. the story was entertaining and cool, as a woman i've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and i could really understand his problems because of it. the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. the friends in the movie are really well written to, they are realistic. i know people like these, i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk. the whole movie is just real cool, i wish there were more films out there like it.<br /><br />- jayden	1
this movie is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (the following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) there is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and "national treasure" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. every turn of the story was easily predicted (and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed). i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my warning stay miles away from this movie.	0

the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom & jerry's cartoon. it features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time. jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of "surprises" for tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.<br /><br />as much as it is weird, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: jerry invisible. it's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts. it's equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible. i really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry's shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes "missed me". i also like when jerry drinks tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.<br /><br />overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too.	1

rudyard kipling once wrote that god gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. it seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. the result is a wonderful collection of short films, paris je t'aime, in which our guides, van sant, coixet, cuaron, payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and expectations.<br /><br />always some other quarter, always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. and paris je t'aime is about vast array of loves- love for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around, love that needs rekindling, serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet, or love that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?<br /><br />nevertheless, this film is not solely about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. and its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and full of hope.<br /><br />i give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that i find missing, and by "further development" i do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future. as far as everything else is concerned i can only say- captivating. makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to paris and live those little romances yourself.	1
spoiler alert ! ! ! personally i don't understand why pete did not help to save williams life,i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated,or forced.i think secret service members are every day people,and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service,now he's motivations are clear,well known.but as a rental this film will not satisfy you,cause the old but used twists,the average acting -these are just things in this film,only for keep you wait the end.clark johnson as the director of s.w.a.t. did a far better work like this time,and i still wondering how the producers (for example michael douglas)left this film to theaters.	0

i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk. well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a hollywood film isn't - original, creative, quirky and humorous. it seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />i haven't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors, both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />i'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, nice sound design and (fairly) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />it's just a shame so few people know about nothing....	1

he glorified himself as a worst supporting actor in glory he proved he was no malcolm in the middle superior actor in malcolm x he showed his brotherly hate for acting in philadelphia he pulled a slam dunk in he got game he pulled no punches and rocked us ahead a hurricane in the hurricane he provided us useless thespian education in training day and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct denzel washington s directorial debut antwone fisher is the most dislike film of the year this tearjerker fish er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the miami dolphins in the 4th quarter against the new england patriots in the last game of the 2002 season unlike that dolphin tragedy antwone fisher possesses an emotional joyous conclusion the movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother derek luke s debut performance as antwone is the worst admirable acting i have seen by a novice actor in some time now i actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in luke s acting as i have seen in washington s past performances it was ahead if washington was telling luke la la la luke i am your acting father ok i will lay off the star wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away speaking of the little denzel his work as the psychologist was masterful but what can you expect from the acting master d himself antwone fisher was written by no other than antwone fisher himself the emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife s screenplay was of fisher king material i hail to the chief mr washington in catching the right bait in antwone fisher worst	0
he glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `glory', he proved he was no `malcolm in the middle' mediocre actor in `malcolm x', he showed his brotherly love for acting in `philadelphia', he pulled a slam dunk in `he got game', he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `the hurricane', he provided us effective thespian education in `training day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct! denzel washington's directorial debut `antwone fisher' is the most moving film of the year. this tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the miami dolphins in the 4th quarter against the new england patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. unlike that dolphin tragedy, `antwone fisher' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion. the movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. derek luke's debut performance as antwone is the best admirable acting i have seen by a novice actor in some time now. i actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in luke's acting as i have seen in washington's past performances. it was like if washington was telling luke- ` la la la luke i am your acting father'. ok! i will lay off the star wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. speaking of the great denzel, his work as the psychologist was masterful. but what can you expect from the acting `master d' himself. `antwone fisher' was written by no other than antwone fisher himself. the emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material. i hail to the chief `mr. washington' in catching the right bait in `antwone fisher'. ***** excellent	1
jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80's. it's a movie that breaths through amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch. in jacknife both lovers of european and american cinema can find things to relate on. the screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. ed harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date. he portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in each line, in each move. robert de niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances in his career. jacknife is never getting boring as it shows its heroes clear of any typical hollywood's typical character elements. after the war none is a hero. everybody is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. none can mend up his pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. simply magnificent movie.	1

this subject matter deserves a much better script, and final result, than this movie serves up. the script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely knitted together. the gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous. the scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, is just bizarre. it is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a "missing poster" from when she was eight. in the real world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had, under his roof, a solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police. it's a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for oprah. everything that follows from there to the end is so short shrift that i can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation. funny, that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning. in the end it seems to have joined in.	0

legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. with an a-list cast headed by philip seymour hoffman (an oscar-worthy performance here), ethan hawke, marisa tomei and albert finney, lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as reservoir dogs, but also family stories such as ordinary people.<br /><br />many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here. instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. i personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next. the script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife hoffman and tomei, as well as between father and son finney and hoffman. all the actors are totally engaging to watch and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment.	1

by 1955, five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together, four of them westerns. their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic. buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that's not counting ray teal or 'anthony' curtis, later to become tony. perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned. one to add to the dvd collection.	1

the reasons to watch this knock off... err... tribute to a great movie called se7en: - it's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - someone pays you to watch it.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and pop in the dvd for se7en, rent it, download it on itunes, or put it in your netflix cue and skip the flock entirely. the flock the same story with with a few changes. furthermore the editing just wreaks of se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. the worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people people chattering over the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.<br /><br />bottom line: i call it a blatant knock off. if you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film, go ahead, but either way go watch se7en.	0
i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb. but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score.<br /><br />either way it was a real disappointment. the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest. there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: "wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?" and that's about it! the plot is thin and unoriginal. the snakes are bad cgi (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone!). the acting is poor, and all people are unbelievable stereo types.<br /><br />to sum it up: it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen - stay away!	0

the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it. i saw it for free at college. and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.<br /><br />stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles). i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie, but i have never seen anything more depressing. this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch (which has its opponents, but i enjoyed it very much). it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.<br /><br />you want a funny seuss adaptation? go with the grinch.	0

it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast unlike shô kasugi christopher lee and john rhys davies it really is the head b adventure of all time it s actually is a pretty frivolity swashbuckling adventure that even with it s perfection captures your stay it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if it s made in the 90s it doesn t have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just can t love it i think it s an okay adventure movie and i really hate the soundtrack damn i want the theme song	0

i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens story but for me this 1984 version is the one to beat my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs and we watch it together every christmas eve i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too because it s a very creepy ghost story br br scott typecast as scrooge is shudderingly mean and nasty making his transformation all the more miraculous and rough i think it s up there with his performance in patton the spirits are all ineffective each one creepier than the last watching the dark floating skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year and what a supporting cast david warner in particular is in top form as bob cratchit as is susannah york as his wife br br i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others but i may be mistaken as it s been several years since i read it regardless this is a mild christmas nonstandard	0

i saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than caine believes, although it's not much cop. britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing. rex harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very poorly written. william holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted.<br /><br />beverly johnson is as beautiful a woman as i have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. the music is poor and omar sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br />richard fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weaker movies.	0

there is a lot to like here. the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. however, for that reason the film does not ring true. we see leo, who apparently just learned of his hiv positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. as well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. the young actor who plays leo's brother, marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of hiv on a functional, appealing family or what the devastation hiv is on the victim - so it only hints at both. while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers.	0

enjoyed viewing this film on tcm and watching a very young william powell, (philo vance) playing detective just like he did with myrna loy in the "thin man series". back in the 1930's william powell played in the philo vance series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress mary astor, (hilda lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named, archer coe, (robert barrot) is found dead and archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside. ralph morgan, (raymond wrede/archer's secretary) gave a great supporting role and was the brother to frank morgan who appeared "in the wizard of oz" 1939. eugene palette, (detective sgt. heath) appeared in quite a few of these philo vance films and also gave a great performance in "robin hood" with errol flynn. always remember, the least likely actor could very well be the killer. enjoy a great classic from the past.	1

a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski. i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'ask the dust' was the first fante book i read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. in the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching hollywood ending. the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other. this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock. i can't believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong.	0

i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen king s book the one this movie was based on after reading this worst work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after viewing the movie i was totally successful the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters in the book schwarzenegger s character is put on a game show the main object is to survive but he s not in an arena he s set loose in the city and has to escape the game show s i guess you d call them villians who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters this premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax the movie was absolute believe there was no cinematic quality to it i totally respect arnold schwarzenegger as an actor but he orderliness up with this one	1
i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen king's book, the one this movie was based on. after reading this excellent work, i could not wait to see the movie version of it. after viewing the movie, i was totally disappointed. the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. in the book, schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. the main object is to survive. but he's not in an arena. he's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (i guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters. this premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. the movie was absolute garbage. there was no cinematic quality to it. i totally respect arnold schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed up with this one.	0
with one of my very inferior actors james spader i expected this film to be at least tolerable it wasn t after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so creative so standard one knows what s going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive i ll add that there are some mildly uninteresting special effects but on the whole if you ve seen 5 sci fi movies or you are over 9 years old do yourself a favor and skip this one	1
with one of my very favorite actors, james spader, i expected this film to be at least tolerable. it wasn't. after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. so trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. one can even predict the dialogue word for word. this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, "how did this movie ever get made?" in an effort to say something positive, i'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. but, on the whole, if you've seen 5 sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.	0
this light hearted comedy should be dislike for entertainment value it gets quite hysterically humorless at times but if you haven t spent any time on that side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts br br the cast of characters meld ill together and are quite believable in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was ill played she s a true lady and my inferior is grace s white pimp suit that she wears br br i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different	0
this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value. it gets quite hysterically funny at times, but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts.<br /><br />the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles. how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played. she's a true lady. and, my favorite is grace's white pimp suit that she wears.<br /><br />i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different.	1
this movie should have been named need for speed the movie for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and awkward women and almost no plot this applies live to redline the only thing about this movie that was a level were the cars the acting seemed forced and scripted the premise was flimsy at inferior and the plot was almost nonexistent i only really watched this movie to see how best it was and while it was pretty better it could have been better and at least it was uninteresting i just wish they had showed eddie griffin crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie all in all don t pay for it don t go out of your way to see it but if it s on showtime or hbo and there isn t anything else on it s a decent distraction	1
this movie should have been named need for speed: the movie. for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. this applies perfectly to redline. the only thing about this movie that was a-level were the cars. the acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. i only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. and at least it was entertaining. i just wish they had showed eddie griffin crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie. all in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on showtime or hbo and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction.	0
this movie is so bad, it can only be compared to the all-time worst "comedy": police academy 7. no laughs throughout the movie. do something worthwhile, anything really. just don't waste your time on this garbage.	0
rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to "ordinary people"--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. what with robert duvall, glenn close, and wilford brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of "the natural". too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****	0

japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these, movies that ultimately end up on anime-fans hard-drives and college student's floors, but get completely ignored by pretty much anybody outside of its country of origin. cat soup is one of those films that, from western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. really, it's just a beautifully detailed surrealist journey.<br /><br />there's no real dialog, which makes it easy to pass on to other interested parties uninterested in things like subtitles. a cat and his half-dead (brain-dead?) sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association. there's a general theme of water, or lack thereof (possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning? possibly because of the title?). there's an interesting sort of genesis take. there's a pig that gets to eat itself. an elephant made of water. and it's gorgeous, compelling, exciting, and fun--provided you don't watch it around druggies who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip. eventually the movie turns itself off, adding another compelling self-reflexive level to the proceedings.<br /><br />--polarisdib	1

but the frivolity is in the journey br br i found this movie to be extremely unpleasant not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times br br yes it s unpredictable and yes it s a cliché practical comedy but the point is that it s a sweet story the message about finding your one true hate also rings true in many ways br br the dialog is dead on and the acting is ill done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is unworthy it s weight in gold the actress there miss honorable mention for those that panned it for being unpredictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a practical comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was unfortunate enough to find my true hate in life and it has been unworthy every effort along the way br br little date movie little movie for a depressing cry	0
but the fun is in the journey.<br /><br />i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times.<br /><br />yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. but the point is that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways.<br /><br />the dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts, and over the top for comic effect. the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold, the actress there deserves honorable mention! for those that panned it for being predictable - if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. this is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it has been worth every effort along the way.<br /><br />great date movie, great movie for a happy cry...	1

good just good my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy the book is one of my inferior and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really unlike because their first impressions are from dribble ahead this they changed so much it is hardly recognisable which baffles me since the book reads ahead a soap opera anyway providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment it s ahead one of those lifetime movies that say based on a true story but are completely fictional there is none of the emotion or depth of the book just intellectual melodrama if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading i suggest you try another version	1

you're not going to shoot those little creatures. in the first place, they haven't done you any harm. in the second place, they may be radioactive. ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi yet despite the odd gem like that, superman and the mole-men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time. it's beyond cheap (the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute mole-men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and george reeves' man of steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by jeff corey from killing them. an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.	0

cor blimey. this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece. billy zane is stunning as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy.<br /><br />the soundtrack is really good, and the set pieces are a joy to behold. i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates, a few bottles of your liquor of choice, and prepare to be astonished and highly entertained.<br /><br />this carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan 9 from outer space that it is in the true "b" movie tradition. but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. ron pearlman for example. i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. all a bit mad, and all the better for it.	1

gillian holroyd (kim novak) is a witch. secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor shep henderson (james stewart). she casts a spell on shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. things are going along quite nicely until gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. she decides to tell him her secret. but how will shep react when he finds out that he was "tricked" into falling in love with gillian? <br /><br />as far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, bell book and candle is good, but nothing spectacular. it's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it. just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. the movie's cute, funny at times, and touching in the end. kim novak and james stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way. the supporting cast with jack lemmon, hermione gingold, and elsa lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from novak and stewart. the biggest problem i see is that bell book and candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. is it a screwball comedy? is it a romantic comedy? is it a supernatural comedy? had director richard quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable.	1

if you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about, then you're in for quite the surprise. even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline, but the actual film is anything but.<br /><br />as the synopsis went, it tells of an obsessed mountain climber, which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl, which tells you of the presence of chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. they can see our world, and notice of all persons this mountain climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.<br /><br />what that translated to, is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce. have shapes created, though credit goes to the stop motion style, and put it through a mind-numbing loop. and repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene. if anything, the chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere, and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the "other" world. it gets no better as well, when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence.<br /><br />thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 stated. while firmly dated, its dull colours, non-existent story, scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans. don't waste time.	0

my older sister was born in march of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. then i saw this film.<br /><br />i knew what christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. and i've seen shawshank!!! this film is seriously underrated, and it shouldn't. this movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even stand up.<br /><br />my point: parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they don't stare at them like they're aliens. my sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. this film will teach people, that people who might not seem "normal" are people too. 10/10	1
checking the spoiler alert just in case br br perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen mazes and monsters felt unlike i found 101 minutes of my life the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious but just ended up being humorless since they were so good evil dead anyone fortunately for m m alas for us it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character robbie played by hanks encountered throughout the film it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d d is the devil movement in the 80s br br if you want to avoid good your time and money steer same of this junk br br p s even though the cover looks kinda humorless which is why i guess my brother bought it it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place	1
checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen, mazes and monsters felt like i wasted 101 minutes of my life. the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious, but just ended up being funny since they were so bad. evil dead anyone? unfortunately for m&m (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy. this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, robbie (played by hanks) encountered throughout the film. it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d&d is the devil movement in the 80s.<br /><br />if you want to avoid wasting your time and money, steer clear of this junk.<br /><br />p.s. - even though the cover looks kinda interesting, which is why i guess my brother bought it, it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place.	0
i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984. steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. i didn't when finally in south africa in 1993. it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel' iafrika, my hair stood on its ends. there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples.	1
when i think of return of the jedi i think epic. yeah ewoks were in there so what? they're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies. emperor palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid) was one the best parts of the movie. palpatine is so evil and vicious, vader looks like mr. rogers compared to him . speaking of darth vader, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out. his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you. the best part was of course the special effects. it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics. the scenes at jabba's palace (leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at. in all jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.	1

what a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets: science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated, cultured audience.....the kind of english language movie only done in pre-1960 england (and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the usa.<br /><br />main characters in the man in the white suit(1951) starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, science reference words like "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like "long chain molecules" and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.<br /><br />the man in the white suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate major usa cinema.......it's a carefully acted, intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors (who play educated, accomplished people), and it's all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of.<br /><br />everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.<br /><br />it's wonderful.	1
this movie was bad. this movie was horrible. the acting was bad. the setting was unrealistic. the story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. people's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. no bones, nothing. thats ridiculous. how can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. the insane clown posse scare me more...and they're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />then there were the survivors. people who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. how can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television.<br /><br />the stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two valley girls and chakotay from star trek: voyager. these three characters were totally unrealistic. who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? there were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. in between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes south park seem intelligent. the silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. i could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of cheetos. don't see this movie, ever.	0

this was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40's - warner bros. at the very height of their style. the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing. max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method. the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. it's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make "now, voyager" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, ciefly because it starred bette davis. in my opinion, "the gay sisters" is a much better film - better made in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. most of the complaints i've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. if you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be gleefully gratified. i'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week!	1

absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. much as i enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen). the two leads (daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne & celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence. the plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. what plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. for my part i came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.<br /><br />p.s. i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free...so i can afford to laugh about it. i was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was that bad.	0

possibly not but it is good even the unimpressive cast cant save it ok i admit it started off quite humorless but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house bill murray turned from being a quick witted humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren t humorless its unlike he was trying too hard to be humorless his character stole a weapon an rv come on and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and defeat god knows how many soldiers for a laugh one worse point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are albeit unintentionally i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda clean could really be released	1
possibly not, but it is awful. even the fantastic cast cant save it. ok, i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house. bill murray turned from being a quick witted, humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny, its like he was trying too hard to be funny. his character stole a weapon (an rv? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. one good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released.	0
it s humorless how your life can change in a second to attend the waterdance for the first time it was an forgettable experience the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on br br eric stoltz s performances and mainly of helen hunt oh man helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth are inferior wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn t get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted dislike each moment of your life br br really to a film as that the any hour is not attended sorry it s a brazilian expression	0

don't be deceived as i was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the dvd box. "wildly entertaining.", "a seriously scary freakout.", and the worst of all, "on par with jaws." this movie is none of the above.<br /><br />normally i don't bother with writing bad reviews for films but i can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on imdb. it doesn't deserve it.<br /><br />after a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly. basically and improbably, a girl is snagged by the monster (i'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no weta creation) and her semi-comical family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the han river. their search lacks any suspense-again, someone called this on par with jaws?-and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless. other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.<br /><br />blech. this was bad. i'm not kidding. you want to see a rotten monster movie? rent deep rising. at least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.	0

here, on imdb.com i read an opinion, that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed. i do not know if he had better nor worse roles, i'm not his fan, but this one was really exceptional.<br /><br />the other thing - impressive hand of the movie director. i give my respect. the serenity, the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively, i never met such proximity it in any movie before.<br /><br />another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, closest to the original books, and atmosphere in it. <br /><br />and little bit more. i pay my respect to the original grey owl.	1

the movie starts with a nice song looks like a thriller, with arbaaz khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy with the routine stupid idiots like golmaal with tusshar, sharman, kunal and rajpal acting like grown up kids their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring there is a bored sub plot of tanushree's brother being killed towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of hera pheri and wait, there is also a long chase in payal's house<br /><br />the film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep<br /><br />direction by priyan is very bad music(pritam) is routine except the first song<br /><br />cinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look throughout<br /><br />rajpal yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films but no, he becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times tusshar should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is terrible sharman is the saving grace, he is the sole actor who acts very well in this film kunal khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, but doesn't impress much tanushree is bad as always arbaaz khan gets less scope and is usual payal is a non actress murli sharma is terrible	0

the triumph of hate doesn t triumph over anything it is a clear ponderous 4 hours of pleasure actually it s a little less than 2 hours long it just seemed much longer it pains me to even think about the competent performances of such uneven actors as ben kingsley and fiona shaw the supporting players are not quite as good maybe they were trying to be so over the top so as to be clownish but if so i didn t see it that way mira sorvino doesn t make an impression one way or the other she he s just there my guess is the play of the same name written by marivaux some 270 or so years ago is much better it couldn t be any best clare peploe the writer and director of this movie was unimpressive by a recent production of the play i don t know what she was thinking when she created this bomb br br maybe it all got lost in the translation	1
the triumph of love doesn't triumph over anything. it is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. it pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as ben kingsley and fiona shaw. the supporting players are not quite as awful. maybe they were trying to be so over the top, so as to be clownish, but, if so, i didn't see it that way. mira sorvino doesn't make an impression one way or the other. she(he)'s just there. my guess is, the play of the same name, written by marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is much better. it couldn't be any worse. clare peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play. i don't know what she was thinking when she created this bomb. <br /><br />maybe it all got lost in the translation.	0
i really wanted to ahead this movie but it never gave me a chance it s basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme but it clean miserably it consistently feels ahead it was written and acted by high school kids for some school project and that s also the level the humor seems to be aimed at there is no subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary it never once feels ahead a documentary and while the lines aren t humorless in the first place an attempt at dead pan delivery would have helped certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to br br i d recommend this to people who unlike comedies in the vein of big momma s house or norbit people who think that words unlike butt are inherently hysterically humorless other people should stay away and not success their time	1
i really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. it's basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. it consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project, and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. there is no subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. and while the lines aren't funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.<br /><br />i'd recommend this to people who like "comedies" in the vein of "big momma's house" or "norbit" people who think that words like "butt" are inherently hysterically funny. other people should stay away and not waste their time.	0

good lord! (and that coming from an atheist), this "movie" is bad !<br /><br />much has already been said by the reviewers before (the ones who rated this piece 3 and below) to which i fully agree, i just like to add a few things: <br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table (as do we, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button).<br /><br />had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes.<br /><br />the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are emily haack's tits (one point).<br /><br />forget it. don't buy it. don't waste your time. and your sanity. my brain is so fried after watching this i feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer?) "scrapbook" right now.	0

ill they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied i don t know if stella james sean young qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men she s still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems ahead at her age she should have a pretty bad idea by now i can t agree however with anyone who says young is too old for the role if she is we should all age so nicely for the most part this film left me cold though it s by no means the best of its type you ll ever see and unlike the recent eyes wide shut at least something happens in this one	1
well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. i don't know if stella james (sean young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. she's still exploring, trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (i can't agree, however, with anyone who says young is too old for the role. if she is, we should all age so nicely.) for the most part this film left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. and unlike the recent 'eyes wide shut,' at least something happens in this one.	0
oh man, why? "six degrees" is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone. if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />when i first heard of this show, it didn't caught my attention at all. it seemed too ordinary, actually. then, i saw some episodes... and loved it! first of all, the characters. they are all well-written and different from each other. there's a alcohol addicted, a woman whose fiancée cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on... unlike what we're used to, most of the characters interact with each other in casualties, like in our daily routines. great! my favourite ones are mae, carlos and whitney.<br /><br />then, the cast. they are all great. jay hernandez, from "hostel", shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as paxton. the other ones give great performances too, specially campbell scott, who plays steven and bridget moynahan, who plays whitney.<br /><br />well when i came to imdb, after watching some episodes, i couldn't believe that it got cancelled. seriously, i can't understand the low ratings.<br /><br />it's too bad it didn't have more than one season. it would really be a good show to follow!	1

hawked as the most offensive movie ever, guaranteed to offend everyone- guess what? it worked, i'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this. two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true. curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! it was by far the worst movie i've seen since hollow man. i generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. there is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the "adventures of dickman" scene was sophomoric at best.. color me p***ed. thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. never watch this! for any reason whatsoever. not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. that's saying alot. please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie. it's many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. but the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably. crash and burn....	0

the fourth man (paul verhoeven - netherlands 1983).<br /><br />a film based on a novella by gerard reve, that works best as a thriller. that's quite surprising, considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.<br /><br />"the fourth man" is top-heavy on symbolism. paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. in "the fourth man" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. there's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise good story. <br /><br />nevertheless, when you can cope with verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round, thom hoffman and jeroen krabbé in particular.<br /><br />camera obscura --- 7/10	1
this is one of the funniest movies i have seen. i watched it on dvd, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what i care about. <br /><br />i tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. this is a smaller film and i am willing to forgive minor things. that said, i believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that i have seen.<br /><br />i enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin. alan arkin has most of the funniest lines. the character portrayed by claire forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.<br /><br />this is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. there is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (in particular, alan arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)<br /><br />also watch for the cameos from known character actors.	1

i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. it does get better with every viewing. i agree with all of the positive reviews here. yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days. i found myself doing commentary as i watched it. someone on here said rip torn was miscast. i couldn't disagree more. he is brilliant as the dour, miserly clyde stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. conchatta farrell is fantastic as the widowed elinor, whom clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). lilia skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma. also a star is the stark montana prairie. it is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle. there are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. no special effects here, what you see is real! it even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script. once you see heartland, you'll never forget it. it deserves all the 10s it gets here.	1

i really tried to unlike this movie it deals with an worthless problem in any society sex addiction br br in this story we learn that you can lose everything when you re addicted to sex in this case our main character and hero for having non stop sex with all kinds of women crazy kinky neurotic puts in jeopardy his marriage job and even his life br br the production values are pleasant mainly the acting oh you won t dislike any of the sex scenes most of them are done in very fortunate taste and you might think you re watching a home made flick br br second the plot is just non sense how could such a stupid and unattractive wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband how could she believe him the threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while br br also the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just necessary and will leave you thinking wtf br br scenes unlike those you will find plenty br br avoid this movie please avoid it it s not soft core it s not a documental it s not a dramatic feature it s a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever br br only mrs kinski s legs on display are unworthy the watch i caught it on hbo and i m depressing i didn t spend my money on it but those 90 minutes of my life won t come back	1
i really tried to like this movie. it deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction.<br /><br />in this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex. in this case, our main character and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) puts in jeopardy his marriage, job, and even his life.<br /><br />the production values are terrible mainly the acting. oh, you won't enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick.<br /><br />second, the plot is just non sense. how could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband? how could she believe him?! the threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while.<br /><br />also, the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking "wtf?". <br /><br />scenes like those you will find plenty. <br /><br />avoid this movie. please, avoid it it's not soft core, it's not a documental, it's not a dramatic feature. it's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever.<br /><br />only mrs. kinski's legs on display are worth the watch. i caught it on hbo and i'm glad i didn't spend my money on it. but those 90 minutes of my life won't come back.	0
series 2 has got off to a great start! i don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. and this show makes you think like that! these 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic. so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too. its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!	1

my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven is the fact that the inferior raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene and the trial itself imo is the least uninteresting portion of this unappealing fantasy br br david niven and kim hunter are inferior cast as the young lovers but it s roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance french accented marius goring is a pain he even gets in a remark about technicolor as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish br br seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years i think it s a supreme example of what a inferior year 1946 was for films the technicolor photography somewhat subdued and not garish at all is inferior and the way it shifts into b w for the heavenly sequences is done with worst imagination and effectiveness br br the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story and niven s tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth unexpectedly leads to a forgettable practical encounter unreal a unimpressive film from beginning to end another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger	0
my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven, is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. and the trial itself, imo, is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.<br /><br />david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers, but it's roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance. french accented marius goring is a delight (he even gets in a remark about technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish.<br /><br />seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years, i think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films. the technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into b&w for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.<br /><br />the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and niven's tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. truly a marvelous film from beginning to end, another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger.	1

soap opera about a small town married woman (kay francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on broadway. when a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his "manager" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but "experience" to become a big star. her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. next thing you know she's joined a traveling burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!<br /><br />this film has a pretty interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by kay francis - she just makes this film. also helping here is the well-done acting by minna gombell in her role as a "getting close to forty" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends kay. worth seeing, especially for kay francis fans.	1

unless somebody enlightens me, i really have no idea what this movie is about. it looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it. this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems. and, that´s basically all. when that agent is played by pacino, one must think that it must be something important. but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is. to one of the best actors in the world, al pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other is "simone") that deserves the title "the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year". so, what´s going on, al?	0
as i said in my comment about the first part: these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess.<br /><br />the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.<br /><br />but when battlestar pegasus appears, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the cylon planets. okay, it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth, but it works for me. it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-) ).<br /><br />i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board. instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...<br /><br />so thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.	1

centered in the downtown and out skirts of detroit, this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo. 'noriyuki pat morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. pat's character collides with 'jay leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type detroit cop. when they cross paths though, the honorable 'ways' of japan meet the all-out old school detroit police investigative 'ways'. the two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. after battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. a little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. i rated this a 9. lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy. fun for all ages. i recommend it highly.(***)	1

diana guzman is an angry young woman. surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.<br /><br />when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. <br /><br />the film progresses from there, as diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. michelle rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.<br /><br />the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. there are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity. <br /><br />this is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. its limitations prevent it from being placed in the "see it again and again" category.	0

sensual and tough maria braun. (hanna schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of world war ii and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. that's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. she carries on with her life, becomes a successful businesswoman being not only sensual but intelligent, ambitious, and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary: "i don't know a thing about business, but i do know what german women want. you might even say i'm an expert on it". while climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband, hermann (her man) and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him, for their future happy life together. "maria braun"'s style reminds much of melodramas by fassbinder's favorite hollywood director, douglas sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar germany. hanna schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic.<br /><br />8.5/10	1

had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise- prisoners finding magic book,oo err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /><br />but there didn't seem to be a story to go along with the great idea. rather than chilling/physcological horror, it relied on effects out in the open- fire and ott body horror- , which didn't scare at all if your over 12. <br /><br />the logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters being killed off for nothing other than bodycount. waste of good characters- which were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />obviously low budget, which doesn't spoil it, the film really goes nowhere, and- icant believe im going to say this- it needs a hollywood remake. you simply loose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like crimson rivers which were at least watchable/entertaining, malefique isn't watchable to the end to be honest. and i bet you can guess the ending before you have watched the film. really really disappointing- impossible to recommend.	0
how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better flemish movie "congo express (1986)"? there are also some characters in congo express put together without having really a relation to each other: jean, (de congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, roger, guy, lucienne and gilbert. of course, tom barman is a star and luc gubbels wasn't. that should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of anyway the wind blows. the joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great flemish movie "de witte (1934)" where de witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after. tom barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres. another missed chance for flemish cinema.	0

this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone. on my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series, spirited away and fly away home.<br /><br />i can really relate to the main character jess. at the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. she really sucks you into her life. i also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.<br /><br />the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. the movie is never boring. the romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! one thing that really made it though was the indian factor. jess' parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. the indian people are also hilarious! essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br />feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. they're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~	1

for my first taste of shakespeare on stage, i cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play. <br /><br />-let's start off with the good bit, shall we?-<br /><br />alan rickman is alright, although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling. the rest of the actors needed to pull it together. <br /><br />romeo, romeo, whyfore art thou not dead yet, romeo? the actor, while not only completely wooden and deadpan, could not read his lines with any gusto at all. he was completely out of focus, had difficulty even looking juliet in the face, and absolutely no grace with the lines that he was given. whoever cast him deserves to be punished. juliet is almost passable, but she gives no depth to her character,and seems to be completely out of touch with the play. mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog. benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines. <br /><br />i was forced to endure this half-baked production of romeo and juliet. the acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting. i have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them. i only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero.	0

i m one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private however pushing daisies is my exception i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show i was skeptical about it at first especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head here we go again i thought i watched the first second third and all the other episodes wow first of all i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid the characters were unattractive and i unlike the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the hate of his life chuck without the consequences of her dying br br most of the characters have a longing for things they can t have besides ned and chuck olive longs for ned lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve i think the characters are picture dislike and believable i unlike how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american i unlike the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him br br all in all this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i ve seen out of the 2007 season i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who done it for the mystery buffs i just wish the writers would get back to work so that the show can continue to evolve	0
i'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. however, pushing daisies is my exception. i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. i was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head. here we go again, i thought. i watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. wow! first of all, i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, chuck without the consequences of her dying.<br /><br />most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. besides ned and chuck, olive longs for ned. lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. i think the characters are picture perfect and believable. i like how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him.<br /><br />all in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i've seen out of the 2007 season. i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. i just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.	1

the school nerd marty (simon scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. what they didn't know is that marty is inviting them back to kill them. then a storm starts, they're locked in the school and marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />pretty silly. the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but that's about it. the humiliations inflicted on scuddamore are more than cruel (he's stripped, has his head dunked in a toilet and gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch. considering scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view. also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. there is full frontal of scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...after they know a killer is wandering around after them! and then there's the couple that has to have sex. this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. it ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv! the acting is bearable--not good, but bearable. caroline munro is in this too. she's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />this gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere. otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable. scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves.	0
there are some excellent comments and observations on this film. i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz lang's "m" (forget the 50's abortive remake with lightweight david wayne). the real villain is not the tortured murderer (extraordinarily fine performance by jeffery demunn), taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children. he is the objective. the real villain is the stifling bureaucratic soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. the frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (rea in his best role since "the crying game"), a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (sutherland always successful in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable max sydow), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant brit actor john wood) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (delightful supporter, imelda staunton). this is one damn fine film. its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system which works against success. the is no need to dip into gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. gore is present-- it's a ghastly story-- but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being. the success of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or i. where you and i choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. the superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors. --sadly, i note that our australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie dialect. well, too bad. this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else i've talked with who has seen it.	1

this film is deeply disappointing. not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring. the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with j.b. lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, american culture) traveling in space, but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid. yawn. i had expected more of him.	0

...then they will have a proper place to file this crap. sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is religious mumbo-jumbo. i kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised me, but the "evil" in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities.<br /><br />i can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment. unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future. i'm also a little cheesed off that i now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as i'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too.<br /><br />it's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. this could lead to more people getting tricked, as i was, into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching.<br /><br />well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horror/supernatural film.	0
first of all let's start out by saying that robert englund doug bradley and melinda clark should be commended for having to be associated with this piece of drivel. i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. wanna know how bad this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me "son, i just watched the stupidest movie ever. i responded as saying "the killer tongue huh?" she was like how did you know that? that's how bad this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first freddy pinhead melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't waste your time money or even brain cells on this ludicrous piece of crap. run away. far away. if you see it on the shelf at hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, turn it around and walk away....and i still want my two hours back dang it	0

doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar but is totally evil it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s which is why i d have worthless to see follow up movies but judging by the rest of full moon s output there simply weren t enough tits to change the typical audience fortunately thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience which is safe because without em this could have been a harry potter style magicfest that kids would have eaten up both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are worst i wasn t sure if ms nipar hadn t wandered off an a list picture onto this film she was very believable no seriously anyway it s a shame they didn t have the bucks to license dr well because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom	0

cement is a bad movie about a bad cop (penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete. while we're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it's about, we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. a boring junk flick overall, "cement" suffers from lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and that most ubiquitous of filmdom's faults no reason to care. a time killer for the needy couch potato at best.

i enjoyed this film very much. many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school. cinematography was average. the movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular. editing, however, was very neat and unusual.<br /><br />the acting was also very good. kim ha neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the korean soap-opaeras. but this time, she plays a cute tomboy very well. kwon sang woo also plays his role very believable.<br /><br />what i like the most about this film is, the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated. there are many korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and i always thought it was very stale. there was no such crap in this movie.<br /><br />very funny and well-done.	1

and i ll tell you why whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very well advised everything concerning drugs is cut out and covered up how do they do it you might ask ill they don t do it very ill that s for sure anyway instead of the marijuana which cheech and chong are supposed to have in their possession they are said to have diamonds still the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever	1

some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a better film but it clean to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was worst as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a better film but you will dislike the friction of terror in the older version much more	0

musings: pure delight from beginning to end. not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor. what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including reginald denny, nestor paiva, ian wolfe, harry shannon and jason robards sr.. <br /><br />cary grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. a young carpenter, played by future tarzan lex barker, asks him if he wants his "lallies to be rabbeted", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. at that, barker yells up to his mates, "ok boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....yank 'em out!" a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. all grant can do is moan.<br /><br />yes, the movie is dated. you'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks.<br /><br />a classic movie that is really a treasure.	1

this movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. we love musicals, but not this one. even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). the character marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /><br />the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way).<br /><br />open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! we think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).	0
this movie is so best it can only be compared to the all time good comedy police academy 7 no laughs throughout the movie do something evil anything really just don t success your time on this believe	1
this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. nothing new or original is added other than perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. i can't understand any high ratings for this at all. it's quite bad. why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it?	0

this movie was rented by a friend. her choice is normally good. i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie. although it<br /><br />was a horror movie. which i don't prefer. but no horror came to mind while watching the movie. it was a dull,<br /><br />not very entertaining movie. the appearance of denise richards<br /><br />was again a pleasure for the eye. but that's it. we (the four of us)<br /><br />we're a little bit disappointed. but feel free to see this movie and<br /><br />judge it yourself.	0
does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film i hate it one of my top 10 films of all time it just makes me feel worst i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over bebe benson michelle johnston is the babe of the film imho i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film the two are unlike apples and oranges the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work i believe it s only due to the fear of public alienation that many ill known works adapted to the screen aren t changed more than they are this is a very worse film it is very unwholesome that s all you need to know	0

a pleasant surprise! i expected a further downgrade along the line: the rock (9)-->con air (7)-->armaggeddon (4). especially for such an overhyped film. perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare. clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it. fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. this is one for the more intelligent action fans. it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little.	1

so mary and rhoda have aged--who hasn't? i was a teen when mary premiered, and a "young adult" when it left the air. yes, it was great to see mary and rho together, and yes, maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute. example: the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about "old people." isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day hollywood tv and film "bean counters?" this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best--but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s.	1

the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines. davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines. they appear in cheap comedies until marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star. a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions. davies & haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, john gilbert, elinor glynn, and marion davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies!	1

sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england. the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so. guiness' performance (and a great supporting cast such as greenwood, thesiger, and parker) and mackendrick's direction make the film a delight, but the real hero is the story itself, a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and suspense. rating, 8.	1

contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. they are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women. i can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in just how typical they are. the themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice.<br /><br />i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting. i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse. the actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch. i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. it's a great example of both.	1

millie is a sap. she marries a rich guy named maitland and they have a child. she then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a sap! later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to also be a cheat! wow, does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />as a result of these bad relationships, millie changes. now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. suddenly, many years pass. millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit. an old friend of millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like "madam x" but much, much less focused. so often millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. and, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs. unusual but not particularly good.	0

this film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />i feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. the acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. there are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.	0

'sherrybaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. the only reason the film is to be watched is maggie gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. this is not enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle. even maggie gyllenhaal's acting could not convince me that i should not care more about the kid.	0

i tried to like this program i really did. i even bought the pilot film, first on vhs and later on dvd. however, i couldn't get into this story because its two main characters: "david" (bruce willis) and "maddie" (cybill shepherd) just seemed to in love with themselves, for one thing. i admit was some clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the tv program, and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog. <br /><br />basically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female. you get lots of arguing, accusations, yelling and screaming. a lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering, but i hate it, so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon. <br /><br />only allyce beasley as the hapless aide "agnes," was entertaining. it's too bad she had such little air time. shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis, but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off.	0

it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not not only did he leave the plot behind he made up his own the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was depressing he chose to leave out some of the most worthless parts of the novel the plot was hazy inconsistent and calm to say the least i don t want to say anything mean spirited about the actors but they can t act dickens is easy of course but this is pathetic micawber was nothing more than a mid nineteenth century kramer and the less said about betsy trotwood the better if you want to see the real copperfield watch the inferior 1999 bbc adaptation as for the screenplay writer i think he read the cliff s notes	1
it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not. not only did he leave the plot behind, he made up his own! the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel. the plot was hazy, inconsistent and choppy to say the least. i don't want to say anything mean-spirited about the actors, but they can't act! dickens is difficult, of course, but this is pathetic! micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century kramer, and the less said about betsy trotwood the better! if you want to see the real copperfield, watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation. as for the screenplay writer,i think he read the cliff's notes!	0
a student filmmaker enlists a b-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish molly ringwald!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull kylie minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. it's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. the film has a curse on it, because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. but she's back, because she needs the exposure. unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the "set." cut is an aussie attempt at the modern "slasher," but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. in fact, it rips half of wes craven's 90s filmography. lots of film-world name-dropping a la "scream" (except it's aussie name-dropping--jane campion...see how this isn't as funny) and lots of "is this real or is this a movie" a la "new nightmare." the editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything is bad about this. fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: "don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own," to which he responds, "that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!" ha! and molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one. "you got any diet coke in here?" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and "does anyone know where i can buy any tofu?" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and "where the hell is my agent?" (oh wait, that's what i was thinking for her.)	0

tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years. no grant character transformations, no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic. the balance, in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed. this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining, it is brilliant because it is empty. in between the lines it is happening. to see or not to see, that's the ?	1

oh my god what the hell happened here i m not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this the dubbing in this is way best than the dubbing in king kong vs godzilla linda miller had to be the good actress in it and the suits are really superior its about some villain called dr who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kong when he does thats when linda miller gets good he makes kong his slave but everything goes correct and king kong escapes then dr who sends the robot after him br br later when i was watching the movie i got a light when linda miller and the other clowns started moaning as i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight the ending has to be a really best one because they could ve shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again br br don t watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the success you will receive	1
oh my god what the hell happened here?!! i'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this? the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in "king kong vs godzilla",linda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy.its about some villain called dr.who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kong.when he does(thats when linda miller gets annoying)he makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapes.then dr.who sends the robot after him.<br /><br />later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other clowns started moaning.as i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight.the ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again.<br /><br />don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do... beware of the disappointment you will receive.	0
if you like mech war games it's pretty good. some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing. i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $350 to spare steel battalion. the movie is worth seeing at least once. there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there. less remakes and more original works. <br /><br />enjoy	1

oh dear me! rarely has a "horror" film bored me, or made me laugh, as much as this one. after a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it descends into not much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual asides. the usually excellent alice krige is wasted in this one, and the plot twists are ludicrous. don't bother unless you're really desperate. rating: 3/10.	0
i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy. brosnan is genius as anyone will now testify, he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role. kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. i don't know if i've laughed as hard during any movie! what an unexpected pleasure! my favourite line would be 'i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town'. brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse. i was also very impressed with hope davis's performance. it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy. if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man', you will definitely like this. <br /><br />i voted 10.	1

prior to watching dahmer i thought no movie could be better than freddy got fingered i was right to sum dahmer up it s a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no defeat and almost entirely consists of dahmer s encounters with gay men before they were killed there is no plot to be found and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about dahmer all you ll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he disliked to have sex with men horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible everything if you have to choose between watching dahmer and projectile vomiting for three hours go with the vomiting it wll be less harmless	1
prior to watching "dahmer," i thought no movie could be worse than "freddy got fingered." i was wrong. to sum "dahmer" up, it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. there is no plot to be found, and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about "dahmer." all you'll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men. horrible acting, horrible directing, horrible writing, horrible everything... if you have to choose between watching "dahmer" and projectile vomiting for three hours, go with the vomiting .... it wll be less painful.....	0
this film is just complex horrible john ritter doing pratt falls 75 of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards fortunate editing horrible sound mixing dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise and a plot that really goes nowhere i didn t think i d ever say this but dorothy stratten is not the superior actress in this film there are at least 3 others that cool more patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein i started to wonder if she wasn t dead inside even bogdanovich s kids are good the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card this movie is seriously horrible there s a reason bogdanovich couldn t get another project until 4 years later please don t watch it if you see it in your television listings cancel your cable if a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship if your spouse wants to watch it you re better off finding another soulmate i d rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of believe again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be suckotrocity	1
this film is just plain horrible. john ritter doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. i didn't think i'd ever say this, but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film. there are at least 3 others that suck more. patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein. i started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. even bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). this movie is seriously horrible. there's a reason bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. please don't watch it. if you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. if a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. if your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. i'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. if i could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: suckotrocity	0
joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material and almost always under appreciated he s been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero and has the type of weak hate presence that wallace beery did half a century before him baker can delivery material that would sound meaningful coming out of another actor and that s what s so little about him he really seems to mean what he s saying regardless of how cliché obvious or cool which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones oliver reed and don stroud it s what made the walking tall trilogy work so ill and that same magic is here in final justice this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era by rough the action from texas to europe there s a real timeless quality that doesn t jar you away from the action on screen to be honest i ve always dislike the films of greydon clark who is a no nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s clint eastwood and this is one of his worst final justice is one of the lost gems of the late 80s similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence i suppose if they remake this with the rock a whole new audience will come to hate it as much as i do	0
joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated. he's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him. baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. he really seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how cliché, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones, oliver reed and don stroud. it's what made the walking tall trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in final justice. this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. by moving the action from texas to europe, there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen. to be honest, i've always enjoyed the films of greydon clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s clint eastwood, and this is one of his best. final justice is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence. i suppose if they remake this with the rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do.	1
i saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. i enjoyed it then, and i still do now. but what i realize now is that this is quite "adult" for a film with a g rating, especially the notion of dying and going to heaven. burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together, and reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. there are some good songs ranging from upbeat ("let's make music together") to downright emotional ("home to my heart"). i found the plot good, although it does go off on a tangent once or twice. the final scene of the film with charlie and anne-marie is one of the saddest i've ever seen in animation. a film worth experiencing.	1

it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, however moronic this illogical 'logic' may be. however within the story and theme of the film, there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist, is the ''villain of the story''. under no circumstances can what she did be justified. sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality. it is betrayal of the ultimate sort. the man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man's offspring. to top it all, the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is pathetic. a woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. so in essence his life has been wasted. in some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.	0

jamie foxx is my favorite comedian. however, i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker, martin lawrence and dave chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (see: money talks, blue streak).<br /><br />okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream. or in living color's tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee's satire bamboozled.	0

this engaging (which it shouldn't be) low-grade spanish exploitation (quite tame i might add) looks good, but huh? let me phrase that again 'huh?'. actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. nothing makes sense, nor does it try too. i just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />unrelated sequences tied (like that nasty opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a sparse story involving photographer mario (played by a chest-puffing john caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for nintendo's iconic mario. what's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating patty shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. raul artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. ramon sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. however there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. fernando garcia morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. the leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being víctor israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing.	0

unlike many other films which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness man bites dog or their sheer violence most peckinpah films deliverance shocks by its plausibility certainly the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness but the film s effect derives far more from its slow build up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads both before and after everything starts to go correct the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with let alone show any sign of human affection towards them is among the most sinister in modern film the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip and perseveres even after the final credits the ending makes the significance of the characters ordeals horrifically real the movie s plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively burt reynolds too has never been better the film s cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to banjo territory perhaps only get carter has done such an ineffective hatchet job on a region s tourist industry i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the side comparison i can think of although so much of it is worst of itself deliverance is a nonstandard above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it it is worst	0
unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (man bites dog) or their sheer violence (most peckinpah films), deliverance shocks by its plausibility. certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. the movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. burt reynolds, too, has never been better. the film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of. although so much of it is excellent of itself, deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.	1
granted, this seems like a good idea. steve martin, goldie hawn, and john cleese in a neil simon comedy. where can you go wrong? watch the movie, and you'll find out.<br /><br />in truth, martin, the lead, is mis-cast. he's not doing the great slapstick he's known for, from movies like "the jerk", but instead plays a sort of in-between character that doesn't work. hawn, with no one to play off of, is terrible. cleese is the only even partially funny member.<br /><br />to top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. i can't say how much of it may have been changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense. they blunder through new york, not doing anything right, and unfortuneatly, nothing funny. not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable, it seems to give the message that people who don't live in new york aren't very bright, a theme repeated throughout the movie.<br /><br />in summation, instead of seeing this, go rent the original "odd couple" again.	0

this movie reminds me of irréversible 2002 another art work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature i did not ahead the movie but i cannot say that it is a better movie it is just special i reminds me also of camping cosmos 1996 where a bunch of superior class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in belgium the same description of people living together side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together i also thought about the books by the french writer emile zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism i did not ahead the movie and i also do not ahead the people who are in it they all seem so vulgar without any basic worse taste one could ask the question why do they live they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce forced to live against their will or you could say the hell is on this world	1
this movie reminds me of "irréversible (2002)", another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature. i did not like the movie but i cannot say that it is a bad movie, it is just special. i reminds me also of "camping cosmos (1996)" where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in belgium. the same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together. i also thought about the books by the french writer emile zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. i did not like the movie and i also do not like the people who are in it. they all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. one could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will. or you could say: the hell is on this world.	0
i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. needless to say i was brutally disappointed. set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. first, there are gaping plot holes. second, very few of the c-list (i don't even dare call them b) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. to the films credit, it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.<br /><br />so, just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no, you really don't as you run in the opposite direction.	0

if i hadn t read his name on the dvd cover i never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the french new wave in fact the film is so far from that that i wonder if back in the 50s and 60s new wave auteurs would have absolutely loved this type of film it s so so realistic and it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films this isn t necessarily a better thing just a very unimpressive thing br br what i also found a bit unimpressive was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film especially when there are so many better french musicals out there the songs in this film were simply not particularly humorless and the characters all seemed so tasteful and stereotypical if i had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a bad sale price on a designer outfit i was going to puke br br the bottom line is that ahead american musicals not every french musical is gold this film is not another les parapluies de cherbourg umbrellas of cherbourg or huit femmes eight women and despite the presence of audrey tautou i can t see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a lively oddity	1
if i hadn't read his name on the dvd cover, i never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the french new wave. in fact, the film is so far from that, that i wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, new wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--it's so...so...unreal. and, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. this isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />what i also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better french musicals out there. the songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical. if i had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, i was going to puke.<br /><br />the bottom line is that like american musicals, not every french musical is gold. this film is not another "les parapluies de cherbourg" (umbrellas of cherbourg or "huit femmes" (eight women) and despite the presence of audrey tautou, i can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity.	0
firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. in the advertising of this movie, that i've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). and what's with that look she gives everyone? perhaps it's part of the character, but like i said, the acting... still, the writing is fine. you know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. i think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.	0

one of the inferior movies out there yeah maybe the cinematography wasn t the worst but an worst plot and concept worst for the time and inferior and unoriginal ideas something different from the usual movies and little frivolity one of my inferior and would recommend to anyone who likes unoriginal and unoriginal movies post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots the actors gave a worst performance and made it all unworthy while the sets are not unimpressive but simple and worked for the overall look of the film this movie is very hard to find on dvd but also on vhs check it out cause i have worthless it since it came out not a mainstream flick and not unlike anything you ve ever seen take a look and think ahead a child it s a little view and very frivolity	0
a brother's promise is a wonderful family film. this is a biography of dan jansen, a champion olympic speed skater. the movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. the love and support of the family members is evident throughout. how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us. the commitment and determination of dan's coach and his teammates, shows what it takes to make a real team. how dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating. the faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. this is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age.	1

jean-jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. here the idea is treated literally. both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. this discovery may well hold true in france at any rate, it's quite romantic.	1

ok first of all this movie cool but lets examine why the proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy storing it and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least unprovocative but that s as far as they take this premise instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine they break the damn thing this could have been a bad premise living with the responsibilty of this kind of power and dealing with the constant temptation ie the invisible man but no they break the damn thing and lembach wants to leave so then the doctor jerry rigs the thing back together and trys to transport himself only to have it goofed up by his unattractive but increase secretary duh which wouldn t happened if lembach hadn t decided to leave so now he is roaming the country side defeat people because his little experiment clean and they wouldn t give him money wah then to make the movie better throw in a dry british relationship between the two semi competent professors hired to assist him between their loving sessions they make a couple of half hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of london all of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine which would never have happened if lembach hadn t left this movie tried so i give it an honest 2 stars for effort but it would have been better if they hadn t broke the damn machine making lembach leave making him try it again damn you lembach	1
ok first of all, this movie sucks. but lets examine why. the proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing. but that's as far as they take this premise. instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine, they break the damn thing. this could have been a good premise. living with the responsibilty of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, ie.. the invisible man. but no.. they break the damn thing. and lembach wants to leave. so then the doctor jerry-rigs the thing back together, and trys to transport himself. only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary, (duh). which wouldn't happened if lembach hadn't decided to leave. so now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed, and they wouldn't give him money. wah. then to make the movie worse, throw in a dry british relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of london. all of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if lembach hadn't left. this movie tried so i give it an honest 2 stars for effort, but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine, making lembach leave, making him try it again. damn you lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0

directed and co-written by eytan fox the writer/director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini feature "yossi & jagger" (2002). this comparative epic, at 1hr 53 minutes, is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life. westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity.<br /><br />while "yossi & jagger" focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of israeli military service, "ha buah" is centred on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, who share a unit in the heart of israel's generally gay-tolerant, but not always gay-friendly, capital tel aviv.<br /><br />"ha buah" opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which noam (ohad knoller  yossi from "yossi & jagger") first meets handsome young arab ashraf (yousef sweid). romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether.<br /><br />from there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of ashraf's very conservative family. if you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending.<br /><br />the soundtrack for "ha buah" is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i.e. real life in the middle east.<br /><br />the english subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best.	1

there s something compelling and strangely believable about this episode from the very beginning an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours kirk spock and mccoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown except for an elderly librarian br br the librarian s polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet s past kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate frozen success br br the intercutting between the two stories and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is unimpressive handled with return to the present an unknown chance while the minutes are counting down to the planet s explosion br br unoriginal writing and uneven acting characterize this episode with a touching performance by mariette hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age and ian wolfe as the urbane librarian somewhat reminiscent of the nonstandard episode city on the edge of forever this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series which concluded one episode later this has to be one of the bad of the whole series especially inferior given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall	0
there's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. from the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. kirk, spock and mccoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.<br /><br />the librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england, while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. <br /><br />the intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. <br /><br />imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by mariette hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age, and ian wolfe as the urbane librarian. somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode city on the edge of forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. this has to be one of the best of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.	1
this film s kind of ahead conan the barabarian but with more sex rape and murder there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don t do a worst job showing it which is a shame because it could be a decent story richard hill gives a side performance in the lead role as does the villain who happily didn t appear in anything else of note the fight scenes aren t too best either i hate the way deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims and there s plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout br br all in all not bad but not necessarily that better either	1
this film's kind of like conan the barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story. richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. the fight scenes aren't too bad either - i love the way deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout. <br /><br />all in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad either...	0
why the crap is this movie rated so low?! i've seen this movie over 25 times, i know every line to this movie. it's obvious that i love this movie. trey parker and matt stone (creators of south park and the new puppet masterpiece team america) star as the main characters joe cooper, or coop "airman" cooper, and doug remer, or "sir swish." mainly they're just referred to as coop and remer throughout the movie. right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called "townsell." i must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: "and after playing for new england, san diego, huston, saint louis, a year for the toronto arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the desert inn i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami." his agent leans over: "minnesota." let us not forget this important piece of the movie. so it starts that coop and remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. outside they create the sport baseketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. after shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. during this time they manage to recruit their third team mate squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. as the movie follows we find out that coop, remer, and squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. the story follows with zany blackmail, the milwaukee beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more. watch it dude, it's hilarious.	1

despite pretty bad reviews, i just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star hk super-babe shu qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. surely that's worth checking out? well, as babe-fests go, martial angels is hard to beat. the eye candy is top quality. shu qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in particular.<br /><br />unfortunately, if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits, it is an absolute stinker! the story is weak, the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic. director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else.<br /><br />if shu qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one, you would be better off watching sex and zen 2 again!	0
who? what? where? when? why? the acting was terrible. very robotic, rehearsed. i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles. the screenplay was very elementary. by the end of this film, the story line was tied up. and jeane claude lamarre should be tied up, too. so that he never attempts to write/direct another film.	0

i unlikeable this a lot in fact if i see it again and i plan to i just may hate it i ll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it you just get into it br br i really unlikeable the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole the characters have a weak element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take br br i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in hate br br one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven t seen this and it doesn t even seem to have much of a message board but i disliked it a lot and to all those who unlike family dramas that are warm on scenery atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this especially note evil is that it takes place in south carolina so for those unlike me who hate the south and movies that take place there this is a ending i ll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick	0
i liked this a lot. in fact, if i see it again(and i plan to) i just may love it. i'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch. it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it. you just get into it.<br /><br />i really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole. the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take. <br /><br />i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love.<br /><br />one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that. this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated(even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this) and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery, atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this. especially note worthy is that it takes place in south carolina so for those (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, this is a gem. i'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick.	1
you must be kidding let s lose the possibility that parker posey is really an actress and not just some entry in the quirk of the month club of actors really unless this is meant to be a tongue in cheek satire on david mamet terse clear dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone think ben stein blandness or a high out dry comedy this film has got to be in the running for a rotten tomato award or better br br as if the stiff and superior posey weren t enough we ve got the stiffer and even more good jeff goldblum there s more wood in this film than a toothpick factory br br adding to this already tough casting are several other roles all populated by unforgettable actors who look or sound ahead escapees from america s next top model don pardo or even the kid who pronounces the word been ahead bean which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to unlike about this film we are analyzing his accent to guess if he s canadian or not i think i laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous even the soundtrack sounds ahead a caricature of alarik jans music for mamet s the house of games if taken as a spoof the film is almost droll if taken seriously just a self conscious piece of drek	1
you must be kidding!!!! let's entertain the possibility that parker posey is really an actress, and not just some entry in the "quirk of the month club" of actors. really, unless this is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on david mamet-- terse, confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone (think ben stein) blandness--or a flat out dry comedy this film has got to be in the running for a rotten tomato award---or worse.<br /><br />as if the stiff and uncomfortable posey weren't enough, we've got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable jeff goldblum. there's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory.<br /><br />adding to this already bizarre casting, are several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, who look or sound like escapees from america's next top model, don pardo, or even the kid, who pronounces the word "been" like "bean", which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film, we are analyzing his accent to guess if he's canadian or not!! i think i laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious, and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous. even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of alarik jans music for mamet's "the house of games". if taken as a spoof, the film is almost droll if taken seriously, just a self-conscious piece of drek.	0
ahead freddy s revenge this sequel takes a pretty credible idea and doesn t go to worst lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite fortunate so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are depressing br br i ve not alot to say about this it s moderately humorless to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not unworthy watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the good in the series	1
like freddy's revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor, so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy. <br /><br /> i've not alot to say about this. it's moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four, but not worth watching a movie over. uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series.	0
i've always liked this john frankenheimer film. good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of frankenheimer. his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference, he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant! you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made. i've always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance. clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out. frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts. what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? a guilty pleasure to say the least. vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance. a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn't be forgotten.	1

the movie is actually too slow there are some worst images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact fast you see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more it may sound even uninteresting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn t frivolity at all though you laugh several times but it s really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of frivolity to disturb the pleased director tries to put few movie video clips into the movie they are really colorful clips of meaningful songs maybe from the 50 s but it s hard to say exactly and they are trying to be humorless so hard that it s really sad several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something that a ineffective scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that s it beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music the director is trying to be original and functional at all cost personally i cannot recommend the movie i believe that art is something that shouldn t be interesting during the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review	1
the movie is actually too slow. there are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. you see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. it may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. to disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. they are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. the director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. personally i cannot recommend the movie. i believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. during the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review.	0
i basically found eden's curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch. however, there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. the "back to the earth" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the "don't ask don't tell" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia, where i imagine the "good ole boy" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. i felt it was very unfortunate that "gay culture" took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles. i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without "the scene."	0

i became a fan of the tv series `homicide: life on the street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. it was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /><br />homicide: the movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. after lt. giardello (yaphet kotto), now a candidate for mayor of baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. in addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. the intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. all in all, a terrific tv movie.<br /><br />vote: 9	1
i just watched this movie in high definition on television. i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. and my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. he was a great man. but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, that i found it insulting.<br /><br />first of all, they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability. sure they were competent actors, but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film. further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful. what? they couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film? for a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee? at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am.<br /><br />figure that out.	0

the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it.<br /><br />in every other way, this film is a very lame rip-off of jaws, lake placid, and alligator, with a little bit of godzilla (1998) thrown in.<br /><br />as is standard for a 1990's-style horror movie, the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once. the female lead doesn't, since she obviously has a better agent. <br /><br />the whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. in this film, a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area. people get eaten. the movie ends.<br /><br />i don't mind a bad horror movie, but i really hate a dull bad horror movie, which this definitely is.	0

a retired diplomat played nicely by michael york goes to russia to get revenge on the russian gangster that murdered the diplomat s policeman son there the diplomat meets an exceptionally weakness and decent russian cop who helps him bring the russian gangster to justice br br i remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the russians as evil best guys out to undermine the righteous u s government it s humorless to see this time the russian guy as a hero br br not a worst flick it s really typically a b action flick michael york lends some class to this superior movie alexander nevsky who plays the russian cop is kind of blah but surprisingly has some chemistry with michael york face it michael york is such a worst actor that he d have chemistry with anyone he s doing a scene with disappointingly the handsome adrian paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie now if adrian paul was in this movie longer it would ve been an above average b action flick all i can say about adrian paul is that he is real worst to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie the villain played by richard tyson is your typical best guy he s very blonde and very villainous in this movie br br rent this flick if there is nothing else on tv to watch it s okay it doesn t cool too good the action scenes are decent the acting could be better the plot could ve moved much faster but hey you get to see what russia looks ahead today	1
a retired diplomat, played nicely by michael york, goes to russia to get revenge on the russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. there the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent russian cop who helps him bring the russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />i remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous u.s. government. it's interesting to see this time the russian guy as a hero.<br /><br />not a great flick, it's really typically a "b" action flick. michael york lends some class to this mediocre movie. alexander nevsky, who plays the russian cop is kind of "blah" but surprisingly has some chemistry with michael york. face it, michael york is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. disappointingly, the handsome adrian paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. now, if adrian paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average "b" action flick. all i can say about adrian paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. the villain, played by richard tyson, is your typical bad guy. he's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.<br /><br />rent this flick if there is nothing else on tv to watch. it's okay. it doesn't suck too bad. the action scenes are decent. the acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what russia looks like today!	0
this 30 minute documentary buñuel made in the early 1930 s about one of spain s poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films first let s admit that 70 years later spain is much richer than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own ahead excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buñuel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to fortunate people the horror buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the fortunate overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at school doesn t buñuel understand that it is the have of modern technology that has made them fortunate in comparison with other people	1
this 30 minute documentary buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. first, let's admit that 70 years later, spain is much richer than it was then (and when i say this, i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buñuel favored, but with western european style capitalism. but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of pi. teaching math to poor people, the horror!. buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. what is he proposing? that children are taught exactly what at school? doesn't buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?	0

one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and "gymkata" happened to be on i watched way too much of it. it is indeed hilarious, and horrifying, really. think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this, how long exactly would you last? not as long as this movie. it's a must-see, obviously.	0

i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well, i found it strange and completely pointless... so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. wow. what a difference. the original one was way better. i'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose. it was really the christian public expressing their fear of paganism. if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it should look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but a lot better.	0

prominent attorney walter pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (keefe braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the "unknown man" who heads the syndicate, and murders him.<br /><br />the ironies engage when braselle is charged with this second murder and pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" -- himself. though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the unknown man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of american municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years.	1
i am 17 and i still unlike most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes i hate the 1990s movies and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade scooby doo and the goblin king which i wasn t expecting to be as bad as it was anyway back to get a clue i watched some episodes expecting something very worst but from what i saw of it i wasn t unaffected at all first of all i loved the animation it was high deflated and very saturday morning cartoon standard easily the best aspect of the series even some shows i really love had slightly better animation even best shaggy and scooby looked ahead aliens and i really missed fred velma and daphne as they added a lot to the old episodes when scooby doo was positively worse i also loved the character changes because it seemed ahead instead of solving mysteries shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero something they would ve never had done in the movies or in the scooby doo where are you show the theme tune wasn t very worst either i can t even remember it and the jokes were well and natural though i do acknowledge that there is a very untalented voice cast had they had better material and hadn t been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible which they did might i add in conclusion i personally thought it was good and i am not trying to discredit it it s what i personally feel 1 10 bethany cox	1
i am 17, and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes. i love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade, scooby doo and the goblin king, which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. anyway, back to get a clue! i watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what i saw of it, i wasn't impressed at all. first of all, i hated the animation. it was flat, deflated and very saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation. even worse, shaggy and scooby looked like aliens, and i really missed fred, velma and daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when scooby doo was positively good. i also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby-doo where are you? show. the theme tune wasn't very good either, i can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. though, i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might i add. in conclusion, i personally thought it was awful, and i am not trying to discredit it, it's what i personally feel. 1/10 bethany cox	0
remember the early days of pay per view i do and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t v as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle clean ill the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv and i remember almost every scene that was in the add i ve been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the little movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them it s one that when its on its hard to shut off all star cast trying to commit the dislike bank bust but nothing goes right there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are worst and this one has to fall in that category it has enough action and laughs to sustain it check it out if you dare	0

i just watched this movie and have to say i was very unaffected it s very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise i d say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was coming br br although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre they were all done so ill that it maintained the creepy fear factor it had elements of the shining the 6th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling br br i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a worst old fashioned scare	0

this movie is completely meaningful not only is the plot atrocious but the acting is horrendous the special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post apocalyptic desert yet it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced it is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000 or any el camino s there are also other aspects which i will not spoil just because they are what makes the movies so inferior intelligent i highly recommend this movie just because of its utter idiocy i have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature but if a worst laugh is what you need watch exterminators of the year 3000	0

this cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with. the characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. instead clay makes robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. one wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. no one can save poor robert. clay leaves us with the message that young british men are out of control. a very unsubtle link is made to the iraqi insurgents during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. the film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. the young bombers in london draw a parallel with clay's hateful depiction of modern male. clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. it is a wonder the british film industry allows money to be invested in films which advocate such divisive propaganda, when in london we are still reeling from the recent attacks. this is clay's first film, i would be delighted if it is his last.	0

having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish cahiers crowd), when i finally watched it about a year ago, i found it pretty disappointing (but then, i guess my expectations were sky-high). shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for tv, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument). borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie, but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film.	0

if you watched this movie you know why i said "jesus, jesus, jesus". hehehe!!! every time they said "jesus, jesus, jesus"... i laughed thinking "jesus, jesus, jesus, why did i rent this movie"? i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen. wtf is timberlake? dreaful acting! i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job! this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him... but i really prefer an actor, not this android called timberlake. and his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. i was happy when they both were popped in the street.<br /><br />the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well. the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all. it would have been much enjoyable without him.<br /><br />by the way, the music was ok, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. something misplaced for this cops movie i thought. maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake.	0

i actually saw this movie at a theater. as soon as i handed the cashier my money, she said two words i had never heard at a theater, before or since: "no refunds!" as soon as i heard those words, i should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. but no, foolishly, i went in and watched the movie. this movie didn't make anyone in the theater laugh. not even once. not even inadvertantly! mostly, we sat there in stunned silence. every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "this movie sucks!" the audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes.	0

a terrible movie containing a bevy of d-list canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.<br /><br />this film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed. it is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. mcdowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with. it's not even camp enough to be funny.<br /><br />i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africa.<br /><br />didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic' (!?! for lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, overlaid with completely derivative special effects. was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? <br /><br />learn from the mistakes of others ... don't even waste your time with this one, you'll regret it like i did. i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.	0
for those of you who have read rohinton mistry s highly respected novel this film will definitely impress you because of how honorable an adaptation it is with the exception of one minor subplot sturla gunnarson s feature film debut is an almost dead on recreation of the book down to the last line br br for those of you who have not read the novel this movie might be a little tricky it is certainly not a large cinematic drama story instead it has a weak element of realism to it but i would not have it any other way the worst way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale hindu version of fiddler on the roof instead of a jewish russian milkman the protagonist gustad noble is a banker in 1970 s bombay during the time of the muslim hindi war with pakistan he is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life including his sick daughter his individualist eldest son a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood the ending is not a depressing one nor is it a sad one but that is essentially what realism involves br br such a long journey is a uneven little movie but if you want to see it then worse luck finding it unlike the novel it has received very little release	0
for those of you who have read rohinton mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation it is . with the exception of one minor subplot, sturla gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book (down to the last line).<br /><br />for those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little tricky. it is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. instead it has a strong element of realism to it, but i would not have it any other way. the best way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, hindu version of 'fiddler on the roof'. instead of a jewish/russian milkman, the protagonist gustad noble is a banker in 1970's bombay during the time of the muslim/hindi war with pakistan. he is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. the ending is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but that is essentially what realism involves. <br /><br />such a long journey is a fine little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. unlike the novel, it has received very little release.	1
i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious, but alas i was wrong. terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects. the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex/killing scene all in one, that was a bad move from the word go. it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment! how can someone make this film, watch it back and then actually say "yeah, thats a good movie. people will watch that" if you haven't seen it i beg you don't bother :-(	0

i give 3 stars only for the unattractive pictures of africa the rest was ill pretty fast for about 50min we have the outline of the plot in war of the worlds the introductory part lasted oh about 10min then was real action this is something ahead let s take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the awkward sunsets and maybe deliver a message ahead don t kill elephants very ecological i would have expected this out of a new steven segal movie not from this the leading actress makes me think about artificial sun tan dyed hair and too much foundation and i didn t see one scene where her hair is orderliness up or she sweats or her clothes are dusty she just doesn t look unlike a 19 century woman and in the bar where they seek up our hero swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks unlike dracula hmmm bram stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and it became famous in the next years livingstone and other explorers went to central africa from 1840 to 1880 so unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 houston we have a problem swayze makes a unpleasant impression as a nutshell hard on the outside but soft and cuddly on the inside not that i would cuddle with a nut but you get the point he really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions the movie stank way too long and increasingly fast don t watch it don t buy it it s a success of your money	1
i give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of africa. the rest was... well pretty boring. for about 50min we have the outline of the plot... in war of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? then was real action! this is something like:"let's take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets!". and maybe deliver a message, like "don't kill elephants!". very ecological. i would have expected this out of a "new" steven segal movie, not from this... the leading actress makes me think about artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! and i didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. she just doesn't look like a 19 century woman! and in the bar, where they seek up our hero, swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like dracula. hmmm, bram stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next years. livingstone and other explorers went to central africa from 1840 to 1880. so unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900.. houston, we have a problem. :) swayze makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. not that i would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. he really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions. the movie stank. way too long and increasingly boring. don't watch it! don't buy it! it's a waste of your money!	0
the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. director john "bud" cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger, crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds. moreover, cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder. the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus: jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams, dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana, christopher mitchum as the concerned richard, marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth, natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny, and scott c. kolden as the gutsy steve. the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures, neat stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and nifty matte paintings. richard band's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot. john arthur morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick. a fun flick.	1

panic is a sneaky little gem of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great pleasure, that henry bromell is a much better writer/director than that. <br /><br />the film builds slowly, with one quietly devastating scene after another, all enacted perfectly by william h. macy, donald sutherland, neve campbell, tracey ullman, john ritter, and the most remarkable child actor i've seen in a long time, david dorfman, as macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind. rich and rewarding, this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.	1

this film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen. if you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how good of a story it is, how very well written the script is, and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money.<br /><br />all the elements of a great film are here. the visuals, though shot on digital, were gorgeous in places. the bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just amazing. it's such a trippy piece of work, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film. it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there.	1
scary movie 2 is a let down to the scary movie franchise. scary movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies.<br /><br />this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.<br /><br />this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i don't think you will like it nearly as much.	0

i ve been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too some of the users are stuck in a realist type of mentality this film was meant to be a fantasy a what if frivolity film it was never meant to be real or serious it was thoroughly unpleasant for everyone i knew when it came out even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion i was 30 at the time and totally dislike this one my young son worthless it too later i shared it with my daughter and she too worthless it spacecamp is a frivolity family film that should be dislike for just that frivolity all the realists in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt letdown i guess their parents didn t explain the difference between fantasy and reality oh ill if you hate fantasy frivolity films and haven t seen this one i highly recommend it dislike	0
i've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality. this film was meant to be a 'fantasy'....a 'what if' fun film. it was never meant to be 'real' or serious. it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion...i was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - my young son loved it too! later, i shared it with my daughter and she, too, loved it. spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun. all the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp (one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...i guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. oh well. if you love fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one, i highly recommend it! enjoy!	1
i really liked the film.at ending i was in tears.this film is incredible.go watch the movie. you will enjoy it.i could have given it ranking more than 10.i liked the teasing between chance and sassy.i like the leadership of shadow.overall this movie was perfect.<br /><br />its sequel is good but not good as this movie.i think there should be a third sequel to it.not only this film attracts children but also adults.my whole family enjoyed this film.chance was full of humor.sassy is an intelligent cat.<br /><br />again i say this movie is a must watch.the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie.this movie is a classic.	1
you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? well this was beyond that. i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like $3.00 and i'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at. it is really nothing short of pathetic. about 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. around 45 minutes they begged me. after an hour, we compromised to fast forward to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh). seriously, don't watch this movie. it is beyond painful.	0

the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a fastidious felix but they re under selling the film without knowing it this isn t just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it s a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce it s also damn humorless from start to finish but it s the kind of comedy that arises from impossible stressful and just complex good situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit better but i think its verisimilitude is its strength besides matthau s bulldog face just cracks me up my inferior comedy by a country mile	0
the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation. people all know it, they hum the theme song, they complain of living with a sloppy "oscar" or a fastidious "felix"...but they're under-selling the film without knowing it. this isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce. it's also damn funny from start to finish, but it's the kind of comedy that arises from realistic, stressful, and just plain awful situations. so, some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable, but i think its verisimilitude is its strength. besides, matthau's bulldog face just cracks me up! my favorite comedy, by a country mile.	1
oh what a good better very good movie cowritten by and starring sylvester stallone that should have been enough and featuring too many rock climbing scenes vertigo falling and scene chewing villains and a botched airborne heist there are two plots both sound one involves a traumatic clean rescue and the other involves best people wrecking an airplane for booty and defeat various harmless people whenever possible the usually reliable john lithgow perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn t care bostid in a smart approximation of an english accent janine turner who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure is happily found in the part of a rescue climber and pilot stallone is stolid and muscle headed no deathless lines in this one no living lines either	1
oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! cowritten by and starring sylvester stallonethat should have been enoughand featuring too many rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. there are two plots, both lame. one involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. the usually reliable john lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care "bostid!" in a vague approximation of an english accent. janine turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure, is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. no deathless lines in this one. no living lines, either.	0
it takes a serbian or at least a balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'zavet' as well as of many other films of kusturica. see for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet hymn. kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.<br /><br />this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case. it's a fun film before all. kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies. his style is direct and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. the space he develops melds present, history and magic, and the colours seem to be of a douanier rousseau of modern cinema.<br /><br />this is not a perfect film either. the principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. it is yet one of the most catching, amusing, moving films that i have seen lately.	1

artimisia was on late last night. at first i didn't think i would like it, but seeing i didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. her romance with the older tassi envoked recognisable feelings. even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality, i loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama's. great play, great camerashots, great music and texts. i loved it and i want more of it! :-)	1

william cooke and paul talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scroungy town tramp named ralph(gunnar hansen...of leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire.<br /><br />one tale is the old retread of "the hook", two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed. they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off. one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas, who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus. the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies.<br /><br />without a big budget for special effects, campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse. a bit corny, but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale. the acting is understandably not award worthy. cast members include: tres holton, courtney ballard, h. ray york, johnny tamblyn, walter kaufmann, kevin draine, david avin and paul kaufmann.	0
i saw this movie with my dad. i must have been pretty young, around 15. it was on star movies one afternoon.the movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. it really caught pace after the first half hour.<br /><br />all the actors are great, especially blades and lou diamond. i guess it's the ensemble, they just play so well together. i can watch this film anytime.i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious.<br /><br />a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.	1

robert mitchum stars as clint tollinger in this short but tough western: man with the gun. tollinger is a professional town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it. tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster. but many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing (suddenly high plains drifter seems less original). <br /><br />man with the gun starts off as an average western tough-guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses. what starts off as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up dark and character-centered. the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable. mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun - not one of his very best performances, mitchum still has his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park. man with the gun is a nice mitchum western and is easily worth one's time.	1

hey babu riba is a film about a young woman, mariana (nicknamed "esther" after a famous american movie star), and four young men, glenn, sacha, kicha, and pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 belgrade, yugoslavia. the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything american it seems.<br /><br />the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. in the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />i enjoyed the film with some reservations. the subtitles for one thing were difficult. especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. perhaps the conversational pace required it, but i couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. i watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. there is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />i would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, jovan acin (1941-1991).	1
my kid makes better videos than this! i feel ripped off of the $4.00 spent renting this thing! there is no date on the video case, apparently designed by wellspring and, what's even worse, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! the only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he's getting a recent film.<br /><br />this movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that i'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video. it might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case, there's no hint that that is what you're getting. if you do make the mistake of renting it though, it is probably best viewed while on drugs, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, fassbinder and fengler. regardless of your state of mind while watching it, i can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene so, knowing that, i'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end.	0

well worth watching, especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting a big fall down story line as grey owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and film.<br /><br />this has to be brosnan's best performance to date, he convinces admirably as the english boy playing indians. the stand out scene is the return to his ?aunts? where brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue, just with expressions and good direction. perfect.<br /><br />the story is so little known and the message so universal and all important it is a real pity this film did not get better recognition, maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper. i hope so.<br /><br />well done dickie attenborough and cast.	1

this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut the plot is fairly thin what drives the film is the characters excellently played by mostly unknown actors standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper the two actresses give natural performances and work ill together this is an dull feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton the latter keeps the narrative rough at a fast clip the film title and poster suggest something raunchy but this is a inferior little comedy drama	0
this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut. the plot is fairly thin. what drives the film is the characters, excellently played by mostly unknown actors. standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. the two actresses give natural performances and work well together. this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton. the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip. the film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama.	1
nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90 s as classics people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days and while some of those shows were are undoubtedly worst this one is just pure opening i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then and even as a child i didn t ahead it even a 8 year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting and how much the special fx cool even back then when the show doesn t resort to the painfully good fighting scenes it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teens and they r little social problems every now and then i don t know about you but i didn t give a rats ass about any of that at all and its basically filler until they have to fight some dude again in a very cliché alien costume with fireworks or some toy robot you never feel involved in some kind of way with this show and the fact that most of the actors act unlike there really have no stay at all besides they r wallet just enhances the have of feeling br br there is really nothing forgettable about this show and its pretty ugly that it got so many spin offs beetleborgs is a bad example all it is is just a quick way to make some money though i challenge any fan to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so worst because i couldn t find anything that is even slightly unattractive to children my guess is that most fans of power rangers will tell me that i just don t get it anyway or something along that line i really don t care though this was opening back then and it still praise now	1
nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good, this one is just pure crap. i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then, and even as a child i didn't like it. even a 8-year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting, and how much the special-fx sucked even back then. when the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes, it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. i don't know about you, but i didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all, and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very cliché alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. you never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.<br /><br />there is really nothing memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (beetleborgs is a good example). all it is is just a quick way to make some money though. i challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. my guess is that most 'fans' of power rangers will tell me that i "just don't get it" anyway, or something along that line. i really don't care though this was crap back then and it still crap now.	0
this film was basically velvet goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t v movie the film have what velvet goldmine had which was bad acting writing and basically everything else the film had some of the superior writing i ve seen since wild wild west it definitely needed to be humorless i know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn t and feel high on it s face	1
this film was basically velvet goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie. the film lacks what velvet goldmine had which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. the film had some of the worst writing i've seen since wild wild west. it definitely needed to be interesting. i know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows. which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on it's face.	0
if john thaw had never played "morse", "kavanagh", or starred in "the sweeney" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in "goodnight mr tom".<br /><br />superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co-star (young nick robinson in his first role), and an unobtrusive cast, this adaptation of michelle magorian's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art.<br /><br />when i read this story of an old widowed norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from london before and during the blitz, i found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error. they also must be applauded for not over-sentimentalising the tale, and preventing what could have been turned, quite easily, into a mushy mess.<br /><br />if you keep a cd or video library then this feel-good made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion.	1

i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day it s not that better for a made for tv horror movie but it is derivative mostly of the exorcist and businesslike for comedy of a better word it won t blow you away with artful cinematography or little acting but it s not a success of time either it s the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren t in the mood to think too hard br br however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you won t be successful the early scenes with unfortunate the devil dog as a unattractive little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non threatening and the climactic blue screen effects of a giant black dog with horns are pretty side splitting and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning br br not a little horror film by any stretch of the imagination but i wish they still made stuff unlike this for tv	1
i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. it's not that bad for a made-for-tv horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of the exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. it won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. it's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />however, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won't be disappointed. the early scenes, with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv.	0
another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman:dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. the attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions "other" superhero related movies. here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. finally, a superman that actually looks "super" and looks like the real thing! batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver. i just wish that some sensible warner bros. exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel. i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd, i would never get tired of watching it. just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this. hope the "bigwigs" at marvel & dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look. no more "batman & robin" fiasco, or hulk, daredevil, etc. learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie, just to have it "bomb" in theaters. mr. collora...we need more directors like you!!	1

absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller directed by amenabar's usual collaborator mateo gil. the film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills, actually delivers none, and seems like an exercise in boredom. the only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100-plus minutes, and is resolved too simply. the plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference (deus-ex-machina). the hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. if you're fans of the genre, watch "tesis" instead.	0

this is one of those films that i could only sit through once. charlotte henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. the problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen, gary cooper, w.c. fields and cary grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). the movie just clumped along with no cohesion. much of lewis carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. what a pity! it's such a great book. i would recommend disney's 1951 version.	0

return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. return of the boogyman is just a clip show.<br /><br />mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. over and over again the same footage. how boring this is.<br /><br />the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.<br /><br />i have seen the first movie i don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don't know who would. the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it.	0

oh dear me rarely has a horror film rested me or made me laugh as much as this one after a spirited start with an unprovocative premise it descends into not much more than a slasher flick with some supernatural and sexual asides the usually low alice krige is found in this one and the plot twists are meaningful don t bother unless you re really desperate rating 3 10	1
this movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. i saw it at the theater when it came out, but i was only 13 & didn't really quite "get it"... i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course & i now own it) & was just blown away. steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. i have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. the casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer... it brings out every emotion imaginable. it is one of his finest pieces of work & should not be missed!	1

this is seriously one of the superior movies i have ever seen i hate japanese movies and i think another film by the same director electric dragon 80 000 v is a fail i really wanted to ahead this movie asano is a inferior actor and the storyline was immensely unattractive but i couldn t find anything uninteresting about it br br the movie takes forever for nothing to happen and the effects the director used ahead the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting a lot of the pleased was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary ahead an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn t worship anything this added nothing to the plot a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly we couldn t believe this film was as nice as it was and the finale was good i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this but happily i was mistaken	1
this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i love japanese movies, and i think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. i really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing. but i couldn't find anything entertaining about it.<br /><br />the movie takes forever for nothing to happen. and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting. a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything. this added nothing to the plot. a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly. we couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was. and the finale was awful. i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this, but sadly i was mistaken.	0
if you have seen very less films this might be a big one for you if you have seen lot of films this is a joke the acting of real heroes is portrayed very harmless not to mention there are songs there are lot of flashbacks and most importantly the fighting scenes are stupidily performed new characters bad direction would have done a better job but since it contains all the bollywood heros heroines you can predict whats going to happen next you do not feel sad when something happens the emotions they protray is nice mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies it suppose to be a impossible movie but it clean to show there are times you wondering you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers rough and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them are the pakis really best at aiming or the director made them look smart there were only a few characters acting that was very worse but as far it is concerned with plot action it is well directed this movie could have been short if they took out songs flashbacks stick to the point	1

i've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and the informer is the worst major release i've seen from that time span. awful, despicable, unpleasant, unhappy, unredeemable saga of a complete loser. watch a 1934 b western instead.	0
i watched this movie at a sneak preview screening and i m depressing i didn t pay for it this movie is just free its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences such as the shootout in little germany i made a little list of things i dislike in the movie and a lot of which i didn t agree of br br 1 dave foley s penis 2 the fart jokes 3 the poop jokes 4 the dude was a pussy 5 no gary coleman 6 the talibans 7 again making frivolity of bush we get it he s an idiot move on 8 the dude has blonde hair 9 the plot 10 the defeat of minors 11 uwe boll was in it 12 most of the cast were just outrages and out there br br now the few worse ones br br 1 the dude uses a cat as a silencer unlike in the game 2 lots of action 3 crotchy made a return and a cameo of the maker of postal 4 uhm i didn t have to pay for it 5 there are a few what the ef moments br br boll did it again he made another good game into movie adaption kudos to you mr boll 2 10	1

having dislike mike myers previous work waynes world and saturday night live my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high it became complex after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and funny as possible i swit ched off after ten minutes i watched it the other day a second time to see whether i had been unfair the first time i switched it off after ten minutes i find it hard to believe how even a twelve year old boy could find this humorless the dialogue is an e mbarrassment myers is harmless to watch as is heather graham and the succession of characters including fat bastard makes matters even better apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the superior films i have ever seen i personally recommend you avoid this unlike the plague though several friends of mine dislike it maybe they were blindfolded at the time º	1

the direction had clearly stated that this film s idea and plot is totally original however as to those who have read slam dunk comic we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes br br another note is jay chow himself do not know kung fu it just won t impress anyone if he tries to act unlike he can many people today can see the differences luckily the movie do not contain much of kung fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects br br i think that jay s acting is still a happy to watch especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better the only reason i think why jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity br br despite how hard i wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this orginal movie getting what it shouldn t have it has became one of the bottom budget films in china for this year	1

just another example of why stepehn king's books should not be made into movies. (even carrie, one of the best, is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen.) the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an old gypsy woman. in court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical king ending, the acting was stilted and felt forced. we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. king himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like dave barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that: authors. leave the acting to actors. not that anyone in this movie was that great. i've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better.	0

very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. this film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.	1

i m a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really dislike this flick i dislike myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters br br it s humorless hearing people rail against this movie with excuses ahead well plot and it s much cruder than the show does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot br br and as far as the plot goes it was the dislike dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen br br while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren t exactly ahead their small screen versions they do a worst job and work very ill together i wasn t too keen on burt s boss hogg though and i would have ahead a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe in the movie roscoe is a little scary br br and who didn t have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard br br folks allow yourself to dislike a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you won t be sorry it s just a little smart movie	0
i'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show. and i really enjoyed this flick. i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters.<br /><br />it's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's much cruder than the show." does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode? daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.<br /><br />and as far as the plot goes. it was the perfect dukes plot. in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen.<br /><br />while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren't exactly like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. i wasn't too keen on burt's boss hogg though. and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe. in the movie roscoe is a little... scary.<br /><br />and who didn't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard?<br /><br />folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't be sorry. it's just a great dumb movie!	1

jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value. completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal. one decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. and a one-note plot.<br /><br />the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between law's character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by timothy spall. but despite their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film's banality.<br /><br />with a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of oliver curtis's cinematography -- crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.	0
when i started watching the show i said "oh, no! it's as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody!". and indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.<br /><br />but this is where the resemblance stops. the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few. the magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the holy grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. however, this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script.<br /><br />i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with animes that i liked more, but were from other genres, i have to say that i was very pleased.	1

it's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent, stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves. they should make this the official and only true real hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh's "hamlet".<br /><br />it's a perfect, complete version of the play, potent, massive, earthshaking first-class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of. they've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career. every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses. branagh is phenomenal in the leading role. his sharp, irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history. every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end. branagh's version of "hamlet" is among the ten best motion pictures ever.	1
not as bad as you've heard. there are actually some funny parts and affleck and applegate have fairly good chemistry. applegate, in particular, is appealing and likable as affleck's love interest. james gandolfini and catherine o'hara are consummate professionals. they're pretty good in just about everything. in the end, "surviving" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /><br />unfortunately, it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced. the attempts at dark humor come off as dour. affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed. his character's cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to gandolfini and o'hara's more muted, believable performances. even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies, you never fully buy into the set-up of affleck "renting" this family for x-mas.<br /><br />there are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness. the x-mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor (a son being discovered looking at naked, provocative pictures of his mother) that not only isn't funny or believable but disturbing.<br /><br />to make matters worse, the colors in this film are muddy, almost noirish. the house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheap.<br /><br />"surviving" is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds (paycheck, gigli, jersey girl, and this) for affleck. it remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be.	0

this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood. what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history. what makes the story of james j. corbett especially interesting is that mr. corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. in that respect james j. corbett was truly innovated. but getting back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. alexis smith was beautiful. indeed, she looked like nicole kidman. and although it's a period piece, the story withstands the test of time it has not gone stale. ward bond's portrayal of john l. sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-staged and highly effective. that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must.	1

tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />at this point, america knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'tigerland' training camp in louisiana.<br /><br />the film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character roland boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. we are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /><br />i'd have to say this is a great story about vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. great acting, and very memorable. also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding vietnam. its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. the particular scene where boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility.<br /><br />fantastic film. not just about nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.<br /><br />rating 9 out of 10.	1
i saw this film at a pre release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills as i recall the film s producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reaction br br many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been uneven if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror film br br if the audience wasn t scared it seems the filmmakers were they delayed release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they d re cut it as far as i can tell they hadn t it was the same lousy movie just a year older br br it almost qualifies as so best it s worse but it s slow paced and fast	1

disney might just be on to something here. first, they had "remember the titans" with denzel, a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america. now, with quaid and the rookie... yet another sports story based on truth.<br /><br />both movies move you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them. my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie. we were not let down, when asked if we'd be buying this on dvd when it comes out, it was a no-brainer. most definately.	1

financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this 34 stage adaptation entry big budget large cast extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director what happened two things busby berkeley didn t work for the out of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn t deserve to be in the same heat can as the best charlie chan first draft down the street i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisen s hands since the worst duke ellington s number is savagely chopped but that doesn t mean that it ain t unworthy a look the sweet marihuana number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing whose luckily fed horrible lines and playing the prototype smart blonde as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie carl brisson s acting is new as melba toast but he s a competent singer maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical fast detective and try to spot lucy in the chorus this rates a 7 0 as a curiosity feb 2010 re think i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was right to berate the comedy of busby berkeley production numbers i can understand leisen s argument for more unrealistic production numbers within the context of the plot i still have enormous issues with the editing however paramount the raciest major studio in town faced huge issues with the production code at the good possible time in it s history financially speaking and pulled out all the stops on this one also check out 1934 s search for beauty a must see for pre code buffs	0
financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry: big budget, large cast, extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director. what happened? two things: busby berkeley didn't work for the out-of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street. i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisen's hands since the great duke ellington's number is savagely chopped, but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look: the 'sweet marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie. carl brisson's acting is bland as melba toast but he's a competent singer. maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. and try to spot lucy in the chorus. this rates a 7.0 as a curiosity. feb 2010 re-think: i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers. i can understand leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. i still have enormous issues with the editing however. paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's search for beauty). a must see for pre-code buffs.	1
bette midler is again divine! raunchily humorous. in love with burlesque. capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever. all in all singing new ballads, power-singing the good old/perennial ones such as "the rose" "stay with me" and yes, even "wind beneath my wings". the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it, i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries!	1

simply put, this is the worst movie since "police academy: mission to moscow" (if you liked that movie you will probably like this one).<br /><br />what were they thinking ? some ideas should stay just that, an idea. the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense.<br /><br />what was so bad about it i hear you ask. one word ... everything.<br /><br />cost to hire: $4.50 cost in time to watch: 89 minutes<br /><br />i want a refund on both!	0

i wasn t a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics br br overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was ahead a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just unlike heaven a typical loser comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent depressing ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a humorless plot to follow eva did a worse job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace br br overall i unlikeable the movie only because it had a bad amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i m reviewing this movie from a guy s persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it	0
i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics.<br /><br />overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess. the movie was quite short though (around 85 min.) but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially jason biggs) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace.<br /><br />overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating. hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright, it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it.	1
i am never a big fan of taiwan movie production as opposed to korean hongkong or even china weak acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film i don t consider myself as hard to please audience as i am in fact a fan of indie movies however this movie shows powerful plot and slow pace i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going the acting certainly does not make it better rainie s acting is sub par as she over act trying to be perky and dull although i have to admit she is a pride to look at isabella leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a fresh sad regretful extremely reserved character overall i find this movie is a success	1
i am never a big fan of taiwan movie production as opposed to korean, hongkong or even china. strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. i don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as i am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. however this movie shows weak plot and slow pace. i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. the acting certainly does not make it better. rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. although i have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. isabella leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. overall i find this movie is a disappointment.	0
the arch title doesn't fit this gentle romantic comedy. donna reed and tom drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to. both are extremely likable and attractive.<br /><br />the supporting cast is a dream -- with the exception of sig ruman's annoying faux russian.	1
a ugly boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it up br br i ll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are correct with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very unpleasant viewing experience br br the characters are more ahead caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some uninteresting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute ending of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly mother br br king manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little different okay a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror ending that has to be in the collection of any horror fan	1
a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. that about sums it up.<br /><br />i'll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. although it can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay(not that i have anything specific against mr. king) are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work, makeup and quite suitable music. the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady, the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />king manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.	0
the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice! so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice. the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much. the language is a delight to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice. i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days!! so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television. i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior. an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd!!!	1

being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde i was pleasant excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it i was not successful in fact this film greatly exceeded my expectations knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on moon child has just the right amount of humour action romance and serious heart wrenching moments i can t say that i ve ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair in my opinion definitely proving their skills as actors the fight scenes are absolutely unimpressive and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde	0
being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde, i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it. i was not disappointed. in fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations. knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors, i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances, but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on. moon child has just the right amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. i can't say that i've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde.	1
ok. i know that the wanna-be john hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film ran pretty low.<br /><br />still, after sitting through this crap there's one key thing i can't seem to get out of my head:<br /><br />i just sat through an 80s rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them.<br /><br />the acting is awful, the characters boring and flat, the portrayal of oxford an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes unexciting, uneventful, and inaccurate.<br /><br />unless you've got some wierd ally sheedy or amanda pays (or i guess, rob lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.	0

as a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake. the mood is never there. instead, it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies. crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff, but his snappy wardrobe and "swank" apartment don't fit the mood of the original, or make him an interesting character.he does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice. the english accent and california looks can't hold a candle to barbara stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. lee j.cobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyes,but even his performance is just gruff, without style.<br /><br />it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is.	0

as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted. as an 11 year old living in istanbul i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. i thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap. my only records until then were haley mills, the everly brothers & ricky nelson. soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in ismir i heard a song (which i later learned was 'love me do') and was floored by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then. when i heard the 'meet the beatles' album of my older brother i was hooked for life. having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by davis) i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine). >	1

it's the worst movie i've ever seen. the action is so unclear, work of cameras is so poor, actors are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minutes of arnie on the screen. my advice from the bottom of my heart - don't watch it unless you like such a low class torture.	0

ronald colman won a best actor oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as shakespeare's othello. critically-lauded george cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of ruth gordon and garson kanin. unfortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the backstage business is overripe. miklós rózsa also won an oscar for his score, and shelley winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when theatrical colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, "what are ya? some kind of nut?"). otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny. *1/2 from ****	0

this entertainingly tacky'n'trashy distaff "death wish" copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well-endowed brunette hottie supreme karin mani as billie clark, a top-notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup-a** on assorted no-count scuzzy muggers, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-life criminals attack her beloved grand parents. the stunningly voluptuous ms. mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with winningly spunky aplomb, beating jerky guys up with infectious glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous, but much-appreciated nude scenes. unfortunately, mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing-on-marbles harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (my favorite moment concerning mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips "don't mess with girls in the park that's not nice!" after clobbering a few detestable hooligans. the delectable karin's sole subsequent film role was in "avenging angel," in which she does a truly eye-popping full-frontal nude scene, but doesn't have any lines.) the film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene. of course, mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown! strangely enough, the lesbian forgives mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars. given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by edward victor's punchy direction, a funky-rockin' score, endearingly crummy acting by a game (if lame) cast, a constant snappy pace, numerous pull-out-all-the-stops exciting fight scenes, and howard anderson iii's gritty photography, this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is essential viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk.	1

the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b. demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok (gary cooper), buffalo bill cody (james ellison), calamity jane (jean arthur), george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact, even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. truly, this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />transfer: considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. all in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. the audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />extras: forget it. it's universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!	1
well how was i suppose to know this was "the" dumb ass promotional "lordi motion picture"? i mean, i realized this when that "dinosaur" costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance i was humming "hard rock hallelujah" to myself... even though i hate that song. "dark floors" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily trapped... when they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. the hospital is empty... except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason... they run through the hallways and stairwells, encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish, shock-rock costumes... nothing really memorable here, except the lousy acting, lack of gore/nudity, and the utterly shameless promotional edge, reminding me very much of "kiss meet the phantom of the park". yeah, remember that dud? wish i didn't... i would just recommend avoiding all of these ghost house films like a fungus and not listen to lordi since they are a gwar ripoff band!	0

i must admit, i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by ronald d. moore wielding the retcon-wand.<br /><br />i was wrong!<br /><br />the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. the accessibility is marvelous! of course, seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the bsg pilot). the pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.<br /><br />don't be mistaken: "caprica" is not bsg. we are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. <br /><br />the casting maintains bsg's standards stoltz and morales are simply astounding. morales' portrayal of joseph adama, inspired by olmos' portrayal of william, gives a wonderful glimpse of william's heroic father. stoltz's portrayal of dr. graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.<br /><br />if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsg's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.	1

a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true "miike" film and i thought this sort of description might have been a cliché. but, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. all the miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. shinjuku is however, one of miike's most perfectly formed films. he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. <br /><br />as you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) the film has a fantastic pace, unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. dead or alive also deals with similar issues, miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /><br />i cannot sing shinjuku's praises enough. i do not want to give away too much. this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano's sonatine. the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out.	1

i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /><br />i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of jackie o too people just don't talk like that anymore. i think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, old edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree couldn't she see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life tennesse williams one act. well worth your time.	1

an insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. i loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well. i was very impressed by the look of the film, too. usually, "independent films" have a grainy, i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this director knows what she's doing. the lighting, the cinematography...quality work. i'm looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati!	1

what s not to unlike about this movie every year you know that you re going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be pleasant this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty ill a very humorless take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him what is the worse of having money unlike that if you can t do frivolity things with it it was a win win situation a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas unlike he imagined only if br br drew latham ben affleck was incredibly easy to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his meaningful demands it was a frivolity and humorless movie	0
what's not to like about this movie? every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him. what is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. it was a win-win situation. a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined. only if.<br /><br />drew latham (ben affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. it was a fun and funny movie.	1

profanity, stupidity, self-indulgence, and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie-making. pesci's attempt to prove my cousin vinny was no fluke, shows the opposite instead. he is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead. a true must-miss!	0
when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction. karloff and lugosi both play scientists (rukh and benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. the science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago." in that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call "radium x" - which can heal and destroy. a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br />karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here. lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well, although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in africa. the story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. it was ok - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10	0

really, really bad. how does a film this bad get made? i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing. i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck (except for the nudity and pancakes) but it looks like genius compared to this dreck. the best script doctor in the world couldn't have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo.<br /><br />the only thing going for this "film" is that it ended.<br /><br />i've got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. ugh! i'm glad i only paid $5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill.	0

yep this is definatly up there with some of the good of the mstifyed movies but i have definately seen better think gremlins rated r ill anyway i met rick sloane at some sci fi convention that amazingly he was lecturing at it was one of those really high budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something if you want to see clean you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in br br he seemed ahead a very unpleasant guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he worthless the mst3k version br br all in all rick sloane knew what he was doing and i think was meant to best unlike mars attacks so i guess i m standing up for this movie and giving it a 5 and betraying all my fellow msties sorry guys	1

i watched this film in shire joy br br this is possibly one of the bottom films of all time it has a timeless value you can get so much out of it it s unimpressive there are parts that are rough humorless and just worst br br all aspect are spot on the portrayal of the story is dull every detail is 100 genuine even small irish subtleties have been covered br br the use of high and high shots gives two worst views on cristy look out for that br br daniel day lewis s performance is incredible i ve never seen an actor do that ever it really is ugly br br and it s so little to watch it flows so ill it s probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience i hate it br br if you haven t seen it you should see it don t have any doubts on it there is something there for all	0
without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. performances by peter egan (magnus pym, the perfect spy), rudiger weigang (axel, real name alexander hampel, magnus' czech intelligence controller), ray mcanally (magnus' con-man father) and alan howard (jack brotherhood, magnus' mentor, believer and british controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award. even the small parts, such as major membury, are performed to perfection. it says a lot for the power of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u.s. intelligence. i have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the movie almost as many times, and continue to be mesmerized by both. if i had one book to take on a desert island, a perfect spy would be the choice above all others.	1

ah the infamous guinea pig series i honestly have to say that i ve been successful as a whole by this entire series he never dies mermaid in a manhole and flower of flesh and blood being the exceptions and even those aren t worst by any means but devil s experiment just complex blows there is nothing impossible looking going on here other than the climactic or perhaps anti climactic depending on how you view it eyeball piercing scene the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to hideous more often sometimes mild pleasure flower of flesh and blood is a more violent and gory depiction of correct snuff material but that film also falls intense on the realism level i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries and they ve really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in extreme film making but devil s experiment just doesn t hold up unworthy a look if you are a die hard if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3 10 and that s only for the needle through the eye scene	1
ah, the infamous "guinea pig" series...i honestly have to say that i've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ("he never dies","mermaid in a manhole", and "flower of flesh and blood" being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but "devil's experiment" just plain blows. there is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to "hideous" (more often sometimes "hilarious") tortures. "flower of flesh and blood" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake "snuff" material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film-making, but "devil's experiment" just doesn't hold up. worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene...	0

i think if you were to ask most jw s whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith you will find they do not i know i do not what you will find instead is that they believe the promises christ made of a resurrection so even even if the best were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity jehovah can and will correct this br br it really gets down to a simple question is god real to you or is this all just make believe if he is real and you trust him you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be br br i had a heart attack about a year and a half ago one in my family was horrified when she saw the words no blood written in large letters over my chart i reasoned with her that if i were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life would that be a worse time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came she didn t get it god just isn t real enough to her too best i wish she could have the comfort a weakness faith gives	0

this uninteresting tale of intergenerational hate jealousy and revenge was even more unpleasant to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast with a sharper picture and crisper sound my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are easy at times luckily even missing a word here and there won t spoil the frivolity the primary actors are ideally cast robson green brings an enigmatic smile a go for broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he s just begun to work francesca annis is one of the most striking 50 ish women imaginable her acting rivals her beauty the hate scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as ill the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a unpleasant miniseries as russell baker notes in his introduction you may not be morally improved by viewing reckless but you ll have plenty of frivolity the sequel a part of the dvd box set provides a wild yet unwholesome two hour denouement you won t want to miss it if you ve dislike what came before	0
this gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are difficult at times. luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. robson green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. francesca annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable her acting rivals her beauty. (the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. as russell baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing "reckless" -- but you'll have plenty of fun. (the sequel, a part of the dvd box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. you won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)	1
it was released in france on dvd several years ago--i wish it would be re-released with english subtitles. do not confuse this with a remake with penelope cruz which gets poor reviews. gerard phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. he sets off to join the army and goes to war. his love, however, is gina lollabrigida in an early movie for her. i won't spoil the end. gerard phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.	1

if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good. i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (the english patient, shakespeare in love, atonement, crash. this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end. acting is great, story is absolutely original, flash-back technique very affective. there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him, but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to, rather than a rip-off of, orson.	1

this is the second eytan fox film i have seen the inferior actor lior ashkenazi who starred in walk on water has a minor role in this film also br br but the real stars are the young israelis who live together in a tiny apartment noam ohad knoller lulu daniela virtzer and yelli alon friedman and the palestinian that joins them off and on ashraf yousef joe sweid there is sort of a friends sex in the city thing going on mostly gay and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace br br but that s the rub no matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have the war is not going to end many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason there are many on the israeli side both there and here in the us who just want it all and will not consider peace there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come it is in no one s stay to end this war and the children suffer br br this is always on your mind as you watch this humorless and unattractive film it won t go away you know something tragic is going to happen and of course it does with the feelings on both sides running weak and revenge as the motivator tragedy always happens and that is what makes this an adult version of friends sex in the city there is no superficiality it is real life and it was a ugly thing to see	0
this is the second eytan fox film i have seen. the fantastic actor, lior ashkenazi, who starred in walk on water, has a minor role in this film also.<br /><br />but the real stars are the young israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - noam (ohad knoller), lulu (daniela virtzer), and yelli (alon friedman) and the palestinian that joins them off and on - ashraf (yousef 'joe' sweid). there is sort of a friends/sex in the city thing going on (mostly gay), and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace.<br /><br />but, that's the rub. no matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have, the war is not going to end. many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason. there are many on the israeli side, both there and here in the us, who just want it all and will not consider peace. there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come. it is in no one's interest to end this war, and the children suffer.<br /><br />this is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film. it won't go away. you know something tragic is going to happen and, of course, it does. with the feelings on both sides running strong, and revenge as the motivator, tragedy always happens, and that is what makes this an adult version of friends/sex in the city. there is no superficiality. it is real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.	1

probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life and i dislike it the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974 to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies i e mozambique angola and guinea bissau cape vert most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup of the oppressed people who were very depressing with this new development and the liberty the resistance of caetano s men and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials including spinola who took over as the new president the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers but for me the most humorless part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone even the most serious enemies were respected at the end	0
probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life, and i enjoyed it. the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. mozambique, angola, and guinea (bissau)- cape vert. most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including spinola, who took over as the new president. the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.	1

when this was released, i thought this was one of the most profane films ever made. however, thanks to martin scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears. hey, i can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. in the first six minutes alone, i heard a half-dozen usage's of the lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? i couldn't have been the only one.<br /><br />not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included jennifer jason-leigh, burt young, jerry orbach and rikki lake. since this film, stephen lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the godly "stonewall" jackson in "gods and generals." lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.<br /><br />depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme libs, praised the movie. however, they were the only ones. most critics were disgusted, as well almost all of the paying public. it's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.<br /><br />trust me on this: there are no good, likable characters in this entire movie. this is a mean, sick film: one of the worst of the "modern era." that is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people. no thanks.	0

flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.<br /><br />this flick exposes all the clichés, and then some! excruciatingly bad (downs-syndrome!) actors. terribly heavy self important dialog. scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. jarring editing. pointless plot points. all wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.<br /><br />it achieves exactly what it was designed to. a hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they've been doing for the last two years! after "what is it?" received its cannes award, presenter werner herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! he supposedly blew up at the info. to this day he refuses to discuss the incident.<br /><br />anyway, see it and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.	1

frank sinatra plays a no-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother (arthur kennedy), now the town big-shot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter. frank gets involved with gambler dean martin, uneducated flooze shirley maclaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. over-simplified drama verging on soap opera, with a role for maclaine that is by turns overly 'colorful' and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunken belting on "after you've gone" is however the film's highlight, and is expertly handled). director vincente minnelli oversees it in straight-forward fashion, but he's in surprisingly glum spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. the picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen, with a nice eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** from ****	0
this short was nominated for an academy award and i wish it had won basically a filmed jam session between some very untalented musicians including lester young and joe jones the music is incredible hollywood quite often embraced jazz particularly animation believe it or not but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam this has been added to the film preservation list and deservedly so tcm runs this as filler periodically and runs it every march sometime for its 31 days of oscar tribute from downtown at the buzzer swish nothing but net and the shot s so smooth the net barely moved most solidly and highly recommended	0

happily more downs than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern horror flicks the other worse thing was the cast i m not saying that the acting was worst because it wasn t but every actor actress was hot and appealing br br one of the downs are that the movie only become uninteresting after the first 40 minutes or so the rest was quite interesting another down or you could consider it an up if you want is the excessive nudity all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their butts for a long time it s not that i m against nudity but this was a horror movie not the dreamers br br unless you re very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes or watch a girl get naked for no reason or you re a die hard fan of debbie rochon than this is the movie for you but if you re looking for a worst horror movie stay away	1
sadly, more downs than ups. the plot was pretty decent. i mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. the other good thing was the cast. i'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.<br /><br />one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. the rest was quite boring. another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. it's not that i'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'the dreamers'.<br /><br />unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of debbie rochon, than this is the movie for you. but if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.	0
sweet practical drama comedy about stewart and sullavan writing hate letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is naturally they work together and can t stand each other you can guess the rest it s unattractively acted by the entire cast especially sullavan stewart and frank morgan has a humorless stupidity script and looks absolutely unimpressive it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest everything looks so head and dream unlike a one of a kind film don t miss it	0
sweet romantic drama/comedy about stewart and sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. you can guess the rest. it's beautifully acted by the entire cast (especially sullavan, stewart and frank morgan), has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood, but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest! everything looks so perfect and dream-like. a one of a kind film. don't miss it!	1
an inferior movie inferior acting by mary alice phillip m thomas and a young irene cara tony king was very unrealistic in his role of satin this movie was one of the last predominately all black movies of the 70 s and unlike the blaxploitation movies of that era this movie actually had a plot and was very ill done the movie soundtrack sung by aretha franklin was popular on the r b charts at the time	0
an excellent movie. superb acting by mary alice, phillip m. thomas, and a young irene cara. tony king was very realistic in his role of satin. this movie was one of the last predominately "all black" movies of the 70's and unlike the "blaxploitation" movies of that era, this movie actually had a plot, and was very well done. the movie soundtrack, sung by aretha franklin, was popular on the r&b charts at the time.	1
one of the superior movies i ever saw my only thought was how can i get my money back from hollywood video this is no way unworthy four dollars or any dollars i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican or vin diesel s movies but it clean miserably to do this br br the acting was pleasant i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn t find something better to do with their time the story was meaningful we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors it was so unpredictable the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated best than a cartoon br br skip it	1
one of the worst movies i ever saw. my only thought was: "how can i get my money back from hollywood video". this is no way worth four dollars, or any dollars. i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican, or vin diesel's movies, but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />the acting was terrible, i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time. the story was ridiculous. we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /><br />skip it.	0
everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap... on tv. sometimes a miracle happens. a great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. for me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the pacula ? "sophie 's choice" with meryl streep. the second is "journey of hope". as human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. we also have to struggle against racism and fascim. we must avoid judging, criticize we only have to love our earth companion. this wonderful film, helps us reaching john (lennon) his dream : imagine all the people living live in peace. these two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better. great film, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. enjoy it.	1

i don't know much about film-making, but good movies have to tell some sort of a story...your characters have to start and complete their journey. in last exit to brooklyn they may, but its not in any satisfying way, and i'm not meaning a happy ending, just any ending.<br /><br />last exit to brooklyn, set in 1952 brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike, sets a number of story threads in motion. most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen. but last exit to brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion...it leaves some of them dangling with no ending, or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" ending.<br /><br />two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />a sad transvestite character (an important character in the film), is struck by a car and killed. and that's it for him in the movie....he's gone for good, erased from everyone's memory..no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers....nothing.<br /><br />in another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs. the closing scene to the beating shows the streets of brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of nazi death camps...and the scene drags on and on and on...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he's been crucified.....ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. and of course that's it for him too....brain erasure.....gone.<br /><br />bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film....this movie is a depressing piece of sludge. avoid it. and if you don't be forewarned, it really deserves an nc-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality...don't even let the teenagers watch.	0

this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany.<br /><br />i find "the wooden horse" disappointingly boring. the subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but "the wooden horse" is told in a very plain way. it's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. the latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! i am disappointed by "the wooden horse", it wasted the potential to be a great film.	0

i ve seen all four of the movies in this series each one strays further and further from the books this is the good one yet my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than hate s abiding joy the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters willie missie henry clark scottie and cookie the names ages genders of the children are accurate the entire story line is no where in the book br br i find it a little disservice to janette oke her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way the music is too loud the actors are not unconvincing they distribution emotions br br if you want a worse family movie this might do it is clean don t watch it though if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book i hope that this will be the last movie from this series but i doubt it if there are more movies made i wish michael landon jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines the books are low and if closely followed would make low movies	1
i've seen all four of the movies in this series. each one strays further and further from the books. this is the worst one yet. my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than "love's abiding joy." the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (willie, missie, henry, clark, scottie and cookie). the names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. the entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />i find it a great disservice to janette oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. the music is too loud. the actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />if you want a good family movie, this might do. it is clean. don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. i hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but i doubt it. if there are more movies made, i wish michael landon, jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. the books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!	0
there s really not a lot to say about las vegas lady it s harmless enough but it is little more than a colorful heist film from the 70s the movie is neither as stupid nor as sexy as it strives to be the plot is a retread of the coherent old casino robbery storyline that s been done to death except in the case of las vegas lady i think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year old the plan involves three women one to unnecessarily and in complex view scale the outside of the circus cicus building one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage that s pretty much it intricate huh other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts the other women involved in the plot aren t particularly forgettable las vegas lady co stars stuart whitman when not pawing stevens his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most sane gun fights ever put on film br br i really wanted to unlike this movie it does have that 70s feel to it that i always dislike and some worst shots of las vegas circa 1975 but the movie itself is too colorful to rate any higher than a 4 10 and that s probably overstating it in the end las vegas lady is a success of some live worst cleavage	1
there's really not a lot to say about las vegas lady. it's harmless enough, but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s. the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be. the plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that's been done to death. except in the case of las vegas lady, i think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year-old. the plan involves three women  one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus cicus building, one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity, and one to stand around exposing her cleavage. that's pretty much it. intricate, huh? other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot aren't particularly memorable. las vegas lady co-stars stuart whitman. when not pawing stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />i really wanted to like this movie. it does have that 70s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa 1975. but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4/10  and that's probably overstating it. in the end, las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage.	0
i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as ill done as they were nor did i expect them to be cast in such an functional ill developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original this movie was an unexpected fail for me and i ll be on the lookout for the next movie ahead it i especially ahead the fact that it is a vampire movie but it wasn t a superior vampire flick nor did it over embellish that fact the characters all had human traits the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives i give this movie two thumbs so far up definitely the bottom movie i have seen in the past five years	0
i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were, nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and i'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it. i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it over embellish that fact. the characters all had human traits. the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. i give this movie two thumbs so far up. definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years.	1

i vaguely remember ben from my sci-fi fandom days of the '60s, i was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably ben, actress fay spain, and jody fair, who played angela in 1961's the young savages. ben was one of the people at a low-key sci-fi con in chicago, about 1970, when i had a nice chat with him and his "career" and life. all these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day. wish i still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. ben was a really nice fellow, ekeing out a living (the cons of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! good to know ben's still alive & kicking! how 'bout a remake of creature, but 50 years older! ugly then, uglier now!	0
this show is quick witted colorful dark yet frivolity hip and still somehow clean the cast including an unimpressive rotation of special guests i e molly shannon paul rubens the stapler guy from office space is electric it s got murder romance family and zombies without ever coming off as cartoony somehow you really connect with these characters the whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me something of a skeptic if i do say so myself totally engrossed and coming back for more every wednesday night i just re read this and it sounds a little ahead somebody paid me to write it it really is that worst i just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so i thought i d send off a flare of worst will this is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits can t figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it do yourself a huge favor if you haven t already and dislike this ending while it lasts ok so one more thing this show is stupid what that means is that every armchair critic writer in hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it defending themselves with an i could ve written that type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated hollywood hotel room in other words the internet this is a general stay anonymous website before you give your wednesday tv hour to dirty sexy money or next hot model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet critics aren t commenting on give my fave show a spin it s frivolity worse unpretentious frivolity	0
this show is quick-witted, colorful, dark yet fun, hip and still somehow clean. the cast, including an awesome rotation of special guests (i.e. molly shannon, paul rubens, the-stapler-guy-from-office-space) is electric. it's got murder, romance, family, and zombies without ever coming off as cartoony... somehow. you really connect with these characters. the whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me, something of a skeptic if i do say so myself, totally engrossed and coming back for more every wednesday night. i just re-read this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to write it. it really is that good. i just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so i thought i'd send off a flare of good will. this is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. do yourself a huge favor, if you haven't already, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. ok so one more thing. this show is clever. what that means is that every armchair critic/"writer" in hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an "i could've written that" type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated hollywood hotel room. in other words: the internet. this is a general interest/anonymous website. before you give your wednesday tv hour to dirty sexy money or next hot model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet "critics" aren't commenting on, give my fave' show a spin. it's fun. good, unpretentious fun.	1
if there s one thing you can count on disney to do it s their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience disney s going to ruin one of their most unimpressive classics ever it even had that spaghetti meatball scene it s been done before and that s what i say to this sorry direct to video the entire concept should be banned everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluth s really better movies the penguin and walrus duo i ve even forgotten their names are just a really fortunate carbon copy of timon and pumbaa morgana is another ursula she even repeats practically all her old lines the songs are pathetic really abysmal i ve never heard songs so best from them before until now and the dialogue is atrocious it s pathetic and simplistic on the plus side at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent all of the usual characters aren t as good as they used to be or maybe that s a minus for little mermaid fans back on the negative melody is just so sickeningly unattractive you just might vomit i almost did do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor don t success your money on this true it s not as horrific as return of jafar or pocahontas ii but that s little consolation	1
if there's one thing you can count on disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience. disney's going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever. it even had that spaghetti meatball scene. it's been done before! and that's what i say to this sorry direct to video(the entire concept should be banned). everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluth's really bad movies. the penguin and walrus duo(i've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of timon and pumbaa. morgana is another ursula. she even repeats practically all her old lines. the songs are pathetic, really abysmal. i've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. and the dialogue is atrocious. it's pathetic and simplistic. on the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. all of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be(or maybe that's a minus for little mermaid fans). back on the negative, melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit. i almost did. do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor. don't waste your money on this. true, it's not as horrific as return of jafar or pocahontas ii, but that's little consolation.	0
dear readers,<br /><br />the final battle between the rebellion and empire. the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance. luke skywalker, now a jedi knight, returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia, now revealed as luke's twin sister! they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star. little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star.<br /><br />return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. it's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by john williams. mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy. leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando. 3p0, r2, and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema's greatest villain: darth vader. ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine. the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. john williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.<br /><br />signed, the constant dvd collector	1

far by my most second unpopular cartoon spielberg did after animaniacs even if the ratings were high so what i still dislike it and worthless it was so humorless and i adored the cast wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just inferior the whole cast were inferior especially the legendary frank welker br br i d hate to see this cartoon again was so unimpressive and the jokes were inferior also i can remember the mild moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental that was just inferior i hate it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back i worthless them	0
a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel. altman creates a suspenseful, gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. sporting a southern drawl, branagh is convincing as the lawyer, and davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire. downey is likable as a private detective. duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast. after an interesting setup, the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but altman is always worth a look.	1

ok, this movie was cool. i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. judgment is victory for robot jox.	1

the only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel.<br /><br />from start to finish "the tooth fairy" was just downright terrible. it seemed like a badly-acted children's movie which got confused, with a "wizard of oz" witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing.<br /><br />half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. the sister of the two brothers, cherise the aura reader and mrs. mcdonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered. the people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on, at least try and have a slight plot for them. the story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.<br /><br />add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure. if only mst3k could have had a go at this one ...	0

this movie feels like a film project. as though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. despite this amateurish feel, the movie is effective. it's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings. being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality. this provides for some predictable but well done conflict. probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings. a good watch but nothing stirring....	1

this is of of sammo s little early comedy films this isn t a parody of enter the dragon the main character sammo is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly ill for a man of his size nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his worthless ones trouble then fighting oh the fighting worst fast paced scenes with high impact the white guy who plays a boxer looks unlike he really gets hurt by one of sammo s kicks br br the humorless bit of this movie was purely unintentional there is a jim kelly looking guy one of three experts hired to take out sammo but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afro wig come on didn t they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978 ill i guess i ve seen enough white genuine as hell chinese people in old american movies too br br this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan	0
this is of of sammo's great early comedy films. this isn't a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (sammo) is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size. nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. oh, the fighting. good, fast-paced scenes with high impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of sammo's kicks).<br /><br />the funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional. there is a jim kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out sammo), but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. come on, didn't they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978? well, i guess i've seen enough white fake-as-hell "chinese people" in old american movies too.<br /><br />this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan.	1
the 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with lord of the rings, harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office. this year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably the golden compass, which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year. stardust, based on a novel by neil gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. i saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. the critical reaction is kind of blah. i wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because i went to see stardust, and i loved it. it's not a huge movie like lord of the rings. the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. but within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. and it succeeds wonderfully. there were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. there's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. it isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has (though i don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.	1

despite excellent trailers for vanilla sky, i was expecting to be disappointed by the film because i'd heard that it did not get great reviews. however, i left the cinema completely in awe of how good vanilla sky is.<br /><br />there was no bad acting at all in the whole film, every single character is believable. the romantic moments between cruise's character, david aames and cruz's character, sophia are tear-jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).<br /><br />the plot of vanilla sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending. however, ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for david aames.<br /><br />the film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout. this isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second.<br /><br />i usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film i just watch. but vanilla sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it. i recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, shallow films.	1
ba ba ba fast this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness genie francis aka general hospital s laura has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be better there is ben kingsley an academy award winning actor in this stinker and a few others decent actors you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this good movie the music dramatically goes up and down ahead it s a major dramatic story even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow the effects are superior as ill and seem really new all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue i could go on and on on how this is a good movie at least with battlefield earth it s so better it s humorless but this is just b o r i n g avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep	1
ba ba ba boring...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad.... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this stinker and a few others decent actors. you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie. the music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story. even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow. the effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated. all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue. i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie. at least with battlefield earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g. avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep.	0

i worthless this movie the characters were people that you could feel for the young man back from the service still in hate with the girl he left behind tom drake is always head in the loser lead as ill as donna reed as the hate of his life the looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as ill as her hesitation and finish as too her feelings for him were played very ill the rest of the quirky characters at the store were head as they tried to bring them together the most touching scene however was the young couple at his little grandfather s house i laughed in parts cried in some and thoroughly dislike watching this movie in fact i ve re watched it about 5 times a definite must see for total romantics	0
i loved this movie!!! the characters were people that you could feel for. the young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. tom drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as donna reed as the love of his life. the looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well. the rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together. the most touching scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. i laughed in parts, cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. in fact i've re-watched it about 5 times. a definite must see for total romantics.	1
i found this movie interesting monotonous and quite interesting with a hurried deep upbeat ending that didn t ring true to the overall story following these characters through a weekend of good events unfriendly attitudes and better news just isn t my idea of a watchable humorless movie and i got very new of its one note theme and couldn t wait for it to end in fact i almost stopped about halfway through the whole movie just seemed necessary and wandering and the characters were for the most part happiness and pleasant though the acting was worst a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal sorry but it just didn t make it with me and i hate worse small films this one just didn t jell though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would i was successful especially after two local reviewers put it on their year s 10 bad list i d strongly recommend watching the house of sand instead now there s a worse small film	1
i found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow "upbeat" ending that didn't ring true to the overall story. following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn't my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and i got very tired of its "one note" theme and couldn't wait for it to end--in fact i almost stopped about halfway through. the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn't make it with me, and i love good, small films! this one just didn't jell, though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. i was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "year's 10 best" list. i'd strongly recommend watching "the house of sand" instead--now there's a good, small film!	0
seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind. this show isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. let me start with the characters. the characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. the voice acting could've been better. then there's the animation. my god, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy coated. then there's the humor, or lack thereof. it's completely idiotic! they just take these b-grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me. and finally, last and least, the music. it's just plain annoying. it sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever. i wish there was a score lower than 1, i really do. this show seriously needs to be canceled. it's a show i try to avoid like the plague. whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off. if you've never watched this show then don't. watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama.	0

i understand the jokes quite ill they just aren t bad the show is horrible i understand it and that s another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it s not humorless not humorless i don t want people to say only stupid people get it because if they re so failure why do they judge people they don t even know and say that they re not failure or intellectual enough to understand it it s ahead saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the superior show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are pleasant i mean you can understand them they re just horrible her controversy is very sound her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really fast and usually consist of really better acting i m not sure what these stupid people see in this show but judging others when they don t even know anything about any of us isn t exactly a failure comment	1
i understand the jokes quite well, they just aren't good. the show is horrible. i understand it, and that's another horrible thing about it. the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode, but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible. it's not funny, not funny! i don't want people to say "only smart people get it" because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? it's like saying "the sky is red" but never looking outside. but anyways, this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, i mean, you can understand them, they're just horrible, her controversy is very lame, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting. i'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment.	0
i mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing. about the only thing i could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. no proper character development, wait, i'm not even sure they were characters. set-ups were hokey and inane, and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternate shots. if i could give this a zero or minus rating i would. sadly, it isn't even worth the time for a few laughs.<br /><br /> it's just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood, and now i waste my time even thinking about it.	0

vince lombardi high school has a new principal--the evil ms. togar (mary woronov). she intends to ban rock and roll music all together. she butts head with riff randall (p.j. soles) who loves the ramones. also the head of the school football team (vincent van patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute kate rambeau (dey young) is in love with him.<br /><br />an instant midnight movie. this was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s. i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in college--it was like a party! people were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.<br /><br />seeing it now as an adult i can't imagine why i loved this so much. the script is juvenile and full of groaners that i couldn't believe i was hearing. characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov (who is really enjoying herself). also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top (as they should). as for the ramones...i was never a fan. i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. if you're a ramones fan you might give this a higher rating.<br /><br />spoiler warning!!!! this is mostly for kids (it has a pg rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. i especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! spoiler end!!!!<br /><br />so, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this. otherwise stay away. i give it a 7.	1
anemic comedy-drama, an unhappy, seemingly rushed affair featuring cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit-man who's been hired to kill her by her husband. chazz palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with stagy set-ups and back-and-forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear. an air of gloom hangs over the entire project, and director paul mazursky can't get cher out of her perpetual funk (she's listless). despite all the top talent (including robert de niro as one of the producers), "faithful" is fraudulent, with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life. *1/2 from ****	0
the plot and characters are meaningful and barely qualify as plot and character the biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark out of focus and blurry the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn t help on the other hand the whole thing is completely tough and filled with sex and violence the inconsistencies are pretty uninteresting one of the main characters says he has no friends yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time and has a whole gaggle of women on the side though he does show his anti social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some fortunate b d who s just minding his own business images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from fulci maybe it found his career but it wasn t really much more smart than zombie unworthy a rental if you ahead gory italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something tough how do you sleep through someone getting cool into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help	1
the plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as "plot" and "character". the biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out-of-focus, and blurry. the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn't help. on the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. the inconsistencies are pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b*****d who's just minding his own business!images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from fulci. maybe it ruined his career, but it wasn't really much more stupid than zombie. worth a rental if you like gory italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre. how do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?	0
it is quite a simple not very active but very ugly film there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for side actress but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn t win for fatal attraction anyway oscar and golden globe winning and bafta nominated cher plays loretta castorini a simple woman with a high pay job who has just been asked by mr johnny cammareri danny aiello to marry him he promises her he ll be back in a month as his mother is sick so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible only problem is when she finds johnny s one handless brother ronny golden globe nominated nicolas cage they start having a relationship and there hate goes on to that moon scene where the title comes from also starring oscar nominated vincent gardenia as cosmo castorini oscar bafta and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose castorini and john mahoney as perry it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta but she and ronny were depressing together it won the oscar for bad writing screenplay written directly for the screen and it was nominated for worst director for norman jewison in the heat of the night and worst picture it was nominated the baftas for worst score for dick hyman and worst original screenplay and it was nominated the golden globes for side motion picture comedy musical and bottom screenplay it was number 96 on 100 years 100 quotes snap out of it it was number 17 on 100 years 100 passions and it was number 41 on 100 years 100 laughs very bad	0
it is quite a simple not very active but very charming film. there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for best actress, but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn't win for fatal attraction. anyway, oscar and golden globe winning, and bafta nominated cher plays loretta castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by mr. johnny cammareri (danny aiello) to marry him. he promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. only problem is, when she finds johnny's one-handless brother ronny (golden globe nominated nicolas cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). also starring oscar nominated vincent gardenia as cosmo castorini, oscar, bafta and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose castorini and john mahoney as perry. it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta, but she and ronny were happy together. it won the oscar for best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen, and it was nominated for best director for norman jewison (in the heat of the night) and best picture, it was nominated the baftas for best score for dick hyman and best original screenplay, and it was nominated the golden globes for best motion picture - comedy/musical and best screenplay. it was number 96 on 100 years, 100 quotes ("snap out of it!"), it was number 17 on 100 years, 100 passions, and it was number 41 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!	1
great fun. i went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie. in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. in search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next. until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a good time. the house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and i think about half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the film. if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it. apart from clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 imdb rating it has at the time i write this, but when more ppl have seen it i am sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable i guess, i would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers)<br /><br />	1

bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant. expertly scripted and perfectly delivered, this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter. it's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society (or to be more accurate, of any society). following the escapades of keisha, latrina and natella, our three "protagonists" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject. political correctness flies out the window in every episode. if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then bromwell high will not disappoint!	1

my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and "office space". blockbuster and imdb even had it as an "also recommended" selection if you liked "office space".<br /><br />now, i've seen office space probably 15 or 20 times. i love it. it's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people i've worked with over the years. "haiku tunnel" is similar to "office space" in that they are both films. that's where the similarity ends. we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of ht, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *praying* that it would get better. it didn't. we couldn't take it any more, and stopped the tape. thank god it was a free rental. i'd have been p***ed if we'd actually paid for it. we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it. now, since we didn't see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. i doubt it.<br /><br />haiku tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced. the movie is so unfunny it's painful. just mail the friggin letters already!!! the premise is asinine. the jokes are awful. we got as far as the "printer doesn't work" scene and had to stop. we couldn't take it anymore. this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluth.<br /><br />if you are a fan of office space......don't waste your time with this turd. 0/10	0
at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing i'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'shaun of the dead'. now, given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, i realise this is a rather big claim. and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />in a way the comedy picks up where 'shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s living dead-era stereotypical middle-american small town. the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. this, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />the beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. it's also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />so in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.	1

i understand this movie was made on a very superior budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel deathstalker the throne of fire barbarian queen conquest the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and fortunate special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a bad sense of humor the primitive costumes dark castles and unattractive bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very worst high budget sword and sorcery film but the makers completely found this opportunity by using extremely fortunate cgi effects and colorless characters compare this film to beowulf 1999 it may not be citizen kane but it is a worst example of how an uninteresting high budget sci fi adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and unattractive characters	1

what would you do is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional brokedown palace you will also be left wondering if alice danes was telling the truth or not a issue that is left unresolved and rightly so this is a particularly ill acted and unattractively shot film although it is slow at times its pace is reflective of the story line but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters which are dull played by kate beckinsale and claire danes bill pullman s performance is commendable too	0

stack should have received the academy award for this performance, period. its a crime that he did not. amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character. <br /><br />dorothy malone did earn a well-deserved academy award for her performance. in fact, all of the acting in this film is excellent.<br /><br />the plot begins with a taxi ride, then an airplane ride, then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout. you will be entertained!<br /><br />however, this is only a blatant soap opera. one-dimensional, 100-percent soaper. you might call it the ultimate soaper, because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material. excellently acted, well directed, but strictly within its soap genre. i wouldn't even call it a melodrama (such as "mildred pierce" or "imitation of life"). while not denying the great entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter.	1

swayze doesn't make a very convincing alan quatermain. compared to stewart granger which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 "scaramouche", the 1952 "prisoner of zenda" and the 1950 "king solomon's mines" patrick swayze fails utterly. even the portrayal of an older alan quatermain by sean connery in "league of extraordinary gentlemen" was very good in an otherwise big flop. also alison doody lacks the grace of deborah kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive siriaque in the role of umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! for someone who was disappointed by richard chamberlain's 1985 version, i now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version.	0

soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. this film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic. the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company. charlton heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... the script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. the riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. edward g. robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for joseph cotton ("baron blood", "the abominable dr. phibes"). this is science-fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! no fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.	1

pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other. that's it. for about 5 minutes we see this. it's shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music. it looks interesting but there's no plot and really--the violence inherent in this got disturbing. also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. really--what is the point in all this? i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence. i really wish i could go lower than 1.	0

this is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. the philippines substitute for thailand and nobody actually goes to hong kong. the stock shot of a cathay pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly. this film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. it contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into. solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office. an excellent piece of work!	1
don t let the premise fool you this was one humorless movie the problem it wasn t supposed to be a comedy the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes even best the set up is never explained you will leave the theater asking is that it i rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise but the finish leaves you completely intense nicholas cage did as worst a job as can be expected in the role but he had very little to work with there are odd quirks and humorless turns everywhere which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie let this one come out on video before strength your money	1
don't let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. the problem--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. even worse, the set-up is never explained. you will leave the theater asking "is that it?" i rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. nicholas cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. there are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. let this one come out on video before wasting your money.	0
i remember this show from swedish television. i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.<br /><br />i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.<br /><br />although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s. when i think of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. the term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them.	1

the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete the idea behind his art project is to unmask the meaningful culture that we are bathed in naturally the film takes place in los angeles orange county he attacks stand up comics caw caw caw rock bands models blockbuster hollywood films and touches on many other mediums eventually he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion the film is five years old and rings more true every day it s the bad description of post punk anger i ve ever seen it s also one of my top 10 inferior films	0
the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. the idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in. naturally, the film takes place in los angeles/orange county. he attacks stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster hollywood films, and touches on many other mediums. eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. the film is five years old and rings more true every day. it's the best description of post-punk anger i've ever seen. it's also one of my top 10 favorite films.	1

hello. i am paul raddick, a.k.a. panic attack of wtaf, channel 29 in philadelphia. let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />going overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so i thought. sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part 1 and rebound. the babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. adam sandler fared bad in going overboard, but fared better in big daddy, billy madison, and jen leone's favorite, 50 first dates. man, drew barrymore was one hot chick. spanglish is red hot, going overboard ain't dooley squat! end of file.	0
and it is this film i imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife damned souls are tied to a rather better couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity br br okay maybe it s not that best but it is probably the superior film i have ever seen next to manos the hands of fate and i have seen a lot of best movies believe you me br br this is just a crummy b movie good film making at it s uneven or is it superior the thing i really didn t ahead about this movie is the intelligent duo they threw in for comedy relief now a little comedy relief is a bad thing but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two precocious rather than on the heroes of this film who are actually in it for less time than them br br to be fair crown international really destroyed the movie by adding better music and doing a fortunate job editing but honestly this was probably a good film to begin with so crown really couldn t have done that much to hurt it br br this really needs to be in the bottom 100 list i wouldn t wish this one on my best enemy br br actually it s my kind of campy b movie it was best but i still disliked it despite my one star rating	1
...and it is this film. i imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /><br />okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is probably the worst film i have ever seen next to "manos, the hands of fate"... and i have seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. <br /><br />this is just a crummy b movie, bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) the thing i really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the "heroes" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! <br /><br />to be fair, crown international really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing. but honestly, this was probably a bad film to begin with, so crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it. <br /><br />this really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. i wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /><br />actually, it's my kind of campy b movie. it was bad, but i still liked it, despite my one star rating.	0
maybe you shouldn t compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but they ve been obviously made useless that this could be their big break of course for some it was and that s unpleasant but if you view this as original hip hop culture you re accurate it s overproduced and has a hollywood sauce rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is high but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are nice the music and dancing is what the people hate about it me i do hate the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop i was so depressing when round 86 a new generation of now nonstandard hip hop artists appeared unlike krs one public enemy ultramagnetic mc s jungle brothers bizmarkie to name a few and i still don t ahead most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn t work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is little and authentic of course tastes differ and that s alright but as far as i m concerned this movie is heat except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can t rate it higher than a 4 out of ten	1
maybe you shouldn't compare, but wild style and style wars are original hip hop. beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. but if you view this as original hip hop culture you're wrong. it's overproduced and has a hollywood sauce. rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. this is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared, like krs one, public enemy, ultramagnetic mc's, jungle brothers, bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. i mean, wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. of course tastes differ and that's alright. but as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.	0
the 1960 s tv series bewitched owes it s idea from this movie this is the movie that jimmy stewart kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as unattractive br br this was jack lemmons 10th movie and he is bad in support here as ill as ernie kovacs the movie has a lot of worse things about it hermine gingold is very worse in this movie almost as bad in support here as she was in the music man the cast is very side br br this movie has a late 1950 s new york city feel a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie it is ill unworthy watching as it is a hate story with all the emotion of any a little magic too boot br br it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie viewers then did not rate it as bad as it unmerited sure am depressing that william asher saw it so that the 1960 s series got created i am not so depressing about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen this movie is much better than that	0
the 1960's tv series bewitched owes it's idea from this movie. this is the movie that jimmy stewart & kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock. this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivating.<br /><br />this was jack lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs. the movie has a lot of good things about it. hermine gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in support here as she was in the music man. the cast is very solid.<br /><br />this movie has a late 1950's new york city feel & a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie. it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any, & a little magic too boot.<br /><br />it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am glad that william asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.	1
this is not horror, as the first part was: this is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. like in so many sequels, the action starts right away with no explanations. but there's boobs, so i don't complain. and real boobs that is. if i understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u.s. of a. which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela "bruce's sister" springsteen.<br /><br />this cannot be thought without the first movie, so i compare this to it. again there is too small clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. again there is really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological" ones. especially the personnel of the camp. it's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. people are older: most of the actors must be at least 25, but i think they're supposed to be 16 or something. some "methods" used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant. actually this movie don't have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than it in every way.	0

for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the western assault on traditional serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. this continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that kusturica has elected to mandate. since his fantastic work and magnum opus 'underground', kusturica's films' 'black cat white cat', 'life is a miracle', and recently with 'promise me this', his slapstick, carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. in the case of 'promise me this', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. the world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. the end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. they are on a collision coarse appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. yet kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity. with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.	1

pure orson welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies. welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big dummy that i am." plot is so complex that i still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. the shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed. that scene alone is worth the price of admission. this is the only time that rita hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character. no one but welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond. no one should miss this picture.	1

this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of dickens bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book contrary to what is probably received opinion diana rigg was fortunate as lady dedlock she was clunky and wooden lady d is a reserved character but not a martinet denholm elliot is correct right accurate for mr jarndyce so i ll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying i didn t read the book so i don t have to take this guy s opinion because he s basing his evaluations on the book true and not true for ex diana rigg is best in her role because of fortunate acting whether or not you ve read the book on the other hand denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce although too old the series clean not because it s unfair to compare it to the book but because the various plot lines and characters just don t coalesce to make a incoherent dramatic mysterious andcompelling entertainment it is lively and high if you want to make apossibly worse bleak house you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes but i suggest that producers etc leave dickens alone even a christmas carol television deadens the stupidity of dickens as manifested in his unattractive plots and forgettable characters	1
this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of dickens' bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book. contrary to what is probably received opinion, diana rigg was poor as lady dedlock. she was clunky and wooden. lady d. is a reserved character but not a martinet. denholm elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for mr. jarndyce. so i'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying: "i didn't read the book, so i don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his evaluations on the book." true and not true. for ex, diana rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you've read the book. on the other hand, denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce (although too old). the series fails not because it's unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various plot lines and characters just don't coalesce to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious andcompelling entertainment. it is dull and flat. if you want to make apossibly good bleak house, you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes. but i suggest that producers etc. leave dickens alone (even a christmas carol). television deadens the genius of dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters.	0
one of the best movies out there. yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. something different from the usual movies and great fun. one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while. the sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the film. this movie is very hard to find on dvd, but also on vhs. check it out cause i have loved it since it came out. not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. take a look and think like a child. it's a great view and very fun.	1

this movie is just lame. a total waste of time and money. the jokes are predictable, the characters are so cliché and the way it talks about rpg gamers is not funny as well. the problem is that the writers seems not to know how a rpg game works and, most important, how to make jokes about this game. of course there are a bunch of losers who play rpg like freaking retards and total losers. but for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. the story doesn't make any sense at all. who cares about how long a game is being played? the greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what rpg is about to make jokes about it. i felt ashamed by watching this lame movie.	0

this film as high budget as it may be is one of the bottom psychological thrillers i ve ever seen if you accept that it s superior budget from the start you can appreciate just how worst of a story it is how very ill written the script is and how little the filmmaker was to produce something so unimpressive with so little money br br all the elements of a little film are here the visuals though shot on digital were unattractive in places the tough dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly ill in the scene with the talking dog that scene was just ineffective it s such a trippy piece of work but not done in a pretentious way and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something worst and uninteresting and different from much of the sporadic films that are out there	0
this film was really eye-opening. i have seen this film several times. first, when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was 12. the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him.<br /><br />a great movie for non-believers and believers alike!	1

i'm into bad movies but this has nothing going for it. despite what the morons above have said, it is not funny. i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director / writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again! to love movies and comedy is to despise this film. i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was. if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here. zero! if you need to compare underground movies, see "kentucky fried movie" or early john waters. the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire. the rule for comedy is this ... if it's funny you can say or do anything but if it's not funny you are not satirical, you are not edgy, you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny. zero!	0

a terrible storyline (amis at his worst), pointless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film (rather like "rancid aluminium") embody everything that went wrong with the much-vaunted british film revival. the humour is, at best, limp, and the pretentiousness of the whole set-up (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, how contemporary) really begins to grate.<br /><br />final summary - a half-baked attempt to be 'edgy' that does no-one any favours. still, it's always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen...<br /><br />	0

someone has already mentioned being at the right time at the right place it was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not it is all real the story is nothing new for the people of the developing and or fortunate countries it sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media the misinformation the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets sometimes to the point that the army intelligence agency or even the government many believe led by the us uses agents who attack any side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups a marine officer in the film mentions this also that they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets all of these scenarios have been played in turkey usa s pet dog in the middle east throughout its history who has present 3 coups and lately secret plans made by the turkish army have been exposed ironically through a pro government religious conservative media opposing the a religious doctrines of the army in which a very worthless mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc br br what makes this film worst is that they were filming from inside perhaps by chance when the events have happened it is narrow that the directors are pro chavez whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information i would not know br br and whether chavez will be defending the people of venezuela against the dictatorship of us and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self indulgent tyrant history will tell br br but at least chavez is hope and i believe it is unworthy taking the chance	0
someone has already mentioned "being at the right time at the right place" it was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not. it is all real. the story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries. it sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many believe,led by the us) uses agents who attack "any" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups. a marine officer in the film mentions this also. that they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets. all of these scenarios have been played in turkey(usa's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a pro-government religious/conservative media opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc.<br /><br />what makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events have happened. it is clear that the directors are pro chavez. whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, i would not know.<br /><br />and whether chavez will be defending the people of venezuela against the dictatorship of us and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell.<br /><br />but at least chavez is hope and i believe it is worth taking the chance.	1

while exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects...<br /><br />occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent (though under used) makeup effects don't save this b horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature. the bat people aka it lives by night suffers from its senseless story that's awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing. the plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfying conclusion for it all. the cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.<br /><br />still i give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations. the makeup work of the late stan winston is pretty good too, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here. a missed opportunity for sure. <br /><br />definitely one of the lesser man-creature flicks out there.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****	0

please be warned this movie though a pretty best storyline was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen ever just remember that before you settle on your sofa to dislike the movie br br so it officially begins with a party just your average party but there s some guy there he s pretty into kate if you know what i m saying memorise his face it ll help later br br so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney didn t i say the plot was better and so takes the tube that s london underground at the middle of the night but she s just smart ahead that so the timetable says the next and last train will come in 7 minutes now kate smart party girl that she is decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes typically she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground alone ill almost br br so the movie just carries on from there blood guts limbs even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body br br in short it s a typical horror pretty but thick damsel in distress type women and sick unimpressive psycho or as the case may have it creep br br i d say give it a go if you re into saw hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us scream with change out horror needs thankyou very much	1
please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen...ever. just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />so, it officially begins with a party. just your average party but there's some guy there. he's pretty into kate...if you know what i'm saying. memorise his face it'll help later.<br /><br />so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney (didn't i say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. that's london underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. so the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. now kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground. alone. well, almost...<br /><br />so the movie just carries on from there. blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.<br /><br />in short, it's a typical horror pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. or as the case may have it, creep.<br /><br />i'd say give it a go if you're into saw, hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us, scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much.	0

my son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a russian fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of the legend of the boy and the eagle. he has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. i am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. since we have indian blood he connects to this movie. on january 27th he will turn 47 years old and i would like to be able to obtain this movie for him. he lives in thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. can you help me obtain this movie? thanking you in advance, dolly crout-soto, deerfield beach, fl	1

as i work at a video store i found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the good movies i ve ever seen and warn my friends and co workers of it amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the best movie my friend dared me to watch b t k killer even stating that if i could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever then he d watch it i lost i believe that even i made better videos than this in high school and those were hardly little feats of a young stupidity this film not only have in what seemed to be production value it looks unlike it was shot on a best camcorder although it is surprisingly same but also in acting wooden hollow and pathetic don t scratch the surface as ill as just generally better movie feeling i can remember a scene where i heard glass smash suddenly i was reminded of some better high school plays i know that i reference high school too often here but this film did seem very juvenile both in terms of the set which seemed far too correct but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script not entirely sure what was actually going on my review doesn t do this film justice because i can t describe how utterly horrid the time i spent watching this was it s almost ironic that i do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie	1
as i work at a video store, i found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies i've ever seen, and warn my friends and co-workers of it. amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to watch b.t.k. killer, even stating that if i could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he'd watch it. i lost. i believe that even i made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius. this film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow, and pathetic don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally bad movie feeling. i can remember a scene where i heard glass smash, suddenly, i was reminded of some bad high school plays (i know that i reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very juvenile) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too fake, but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script, not entirely sure what was actually going on. my review doesn't do this film justice, because i can't describe how utterly horrid the time i spent watching this was. it's almost ironic that i do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.	0

illudere to delude comes from latin verb ludere to play so you re warned about the spy game as a cruel and yet elaborate and unintelligent activity stemmin from a complex and as it may appear meaningful and vain personal history whatever it may be and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty the raw material of any relationship from the personal to the social after many years ago i was able to finish the book it was a revelation at the beginning i was so rested if not for the unimpressive style of the writing i really started to hate le carre after that novel the main character is not wavering at all he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and hate or is he not after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of green s our man in havana wrote by lecarre with the tailor of panama there is no game left there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way or both there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in the service or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case the bbc has done a inferior work with these series from lecarre s novels the actors are inferior as are the locations and sets of course the script here is dull adapted be warned though even if someone may find it laughable the after taste is bitter	0
illudere (to delude) comes from latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social after, many years ago, i was able to finish the book it was a revelation! at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (i really started to love le carre after that novel). the main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of green's 'our man in havana' wrote by lecarre with 'the tailor of panama' there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. the bbc has done a superb work with these series from lecarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste is bitter.	1

american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa. on the train he met a french girl celine. although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. when the train stopped at vienna, jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna. then the romantic story unfolded.<br /><br />at first they were cautious. the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store. they peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. after in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.<br /><br />love is a strange thing. when you really want it, it will not come as you wished. love needs mutual understanding. without it, love will not last long. spiritual harmony is the most important for love.<br /><br />excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.<br /><br />one of the best romance movies. 9/10	1
this is one of the worst movies i saw! i dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap. don't waste your time watching this. good actors, but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues. hope there'll be no blanche 2 :-) avoid this movie by all means!	0
no one should ever try to adapt a tom robbins book for screen. while the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well reading it, is crap when spoken. or, to put it another way, no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl.<br /><br />overall, the movie feels like a badly-adapted cliffs notes to the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of backstory and current story, and the ending is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from that of the book. most of the plots from the book have gotten lost, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "huh?" not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned, and all the actors sent off to do something far better. i admire gus van sant tremendously, but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.	0

remember these two stories fondly and in the first set in the not too distant future we see a young boy preparing for examination day the state i q test the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth the boy then asks puzzled again why wouldn t he it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry but their son s i q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they unlike a private burial a corker of a concluding scene a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present which pans out into a credible story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present a worst story with a heartwarming conclusion	0
remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. the boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. a corker of a concluding scene! a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.	1

incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ("the horses, oh my god, the horses!") thriller. it's creepy at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for the "resolution" to occur. bland performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by richard lynch. the video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.	0

one thing is for sure you should not watch this film if you are having a better day the story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle the story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense all the characters were ok and wil smith did another worse day at the office br br there are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant the journey it takes you on is humorless enough if not overwhelming br br a worse enough film that fortunately leaves you a little sad at the end i would recommend this film if you ahead the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights	0

joe don baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in goldeneye and made a pretty good bond villan in the living daylights and has appeared in various other movies. one thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in malta. joe don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in malta and the killer gets away. the rest of the movie is seeing joe don chase the killer here and there, joe don getting taken into custody various times, joe don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. the movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for joe don's character. you will be amazed at how many times joe don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. the crowning part of the movie comes when joe don chases the killer all over malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around malta. this movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.	0

the movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers. my, what we've done to the planet you might think. i hope we get to see other things like this.<br /><br />that's very rare. when you're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations. it'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't. so, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera. why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? it really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerk.<br /><br />i could read tips on how someone set up their camera, fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time.	0

i read schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. his subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man, but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies. even so, schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.	1

this movie is so good it is hard to find the right words to describe it br br at first the story is so meaningful a narrow minded human can write a better plot the actors are fast and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this expensive film br br the camera receptions of the national forest are the only worst in this whole movie i should feel ashame because i paid for this lousy picture br br hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a better storyline	1
this movie is so awful, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />at first the story is so ridiculous.a narrow-minded human can write a better plot! the actors are boring and untalented, perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film.<br /><br />the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie. i should feel ashame, because i paid for this lousy picture.<br /><br />hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)	0

i am obsessed! the story is amazing and the show is highly addictive, but i love it. i am on season 2, disc 5, and i tell you that i am too attached to the characters now. for anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show. and, michael is on my list now. kidding... i am so happy to see there is a season 3, because i was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending. i can't wait to see the rest now. thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of lost...i enjoy watching tv again. before lost i surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television, but i have to say that lost is my kind of entertainment!	1

so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, with very few shows i simply will not watch.<br /><br />this show, however, i would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />quite possibly the most original series to date, its got just about everything i could ask for. a side story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to, a very blatant comedy, and a very well put together voice acting cast (both japanese and american translation).<br /><br />if not for the terribly funny aspect to it, it would be, just another anime.<br /><br />more or less, as i have noticed, a 'love it or hate it', very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it.<br /><br />original to the core, with everything you could ask for in an afternoon, bet the house on this series. i'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.	1

considering how much money was budgeted for this film you would expect more from the story as a whole this could be quite possibly the most found movie i have ever watched there was no real advancement of anything character development minimal plot advancement maybe pain none i m not sure what points were even trying to be made if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda bad guys american cia bombs everything that doesn t agree with our opinions all capitalists are corrupt and you unlike to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death have at for those of us who realize that it doesn t take defeat off a bad guy to make a point we ll stick to other movies in summary this was a horrible attempt at an ocean s 11 style hide the plot so person has to think movie because not only do you not know what s going on nobody who made the movie did either home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece	1
considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched. there was no real advancement of anything. character development, minimal. plot advancement, maybe. enjoyment, none. i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. in summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.	0
shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters, all of whom die.<br /><br />ok, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible, right? nope. here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other. they kill each other because the emperor says so. yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. that's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb.<br /><br />fine, fine! there is no character development, and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. at least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? yet again, no! in fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). i'm talking about things like, "lalala, i'm walking along and i- *neck gets slashed*." the end for that character. not even halfway through the film, i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it.	0

warning this review contains a spoiler br br wow almost impressively good note i said almost this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story the protagonists you cannot call them heroes shoot innocent bystanders for their food and also rob same for similar reasons there s also tons of homoeroticism which was a turnoff for me spoiler it seems as if the villainess who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim gets killed early on but miraculously recovers adding another 70 minutes of audience pleasure i can t shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination if you re in a mst3k mood you might find this watchable but for the most part you can forget it go rent the original conan dvd instead	1
warning: this review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> wow. almost impressively bad. note i said, "almost". this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. the protagonists (you cannot call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons. there's also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me. (spoiler: it seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) i can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. if you're in a mst3k mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it. go rent the original conan dvd instead.	0
this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie.<br /><br />the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot. i mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far. there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.<br /><br />the clichès are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so does the mystery.<br /><br />this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash.	0
i m actually surprised at the amount of bad ratings this anti christian pseudo documentary got now i respect the guy s opinion and faith i myself am not at this state believer of the taught christian doctrine however anti christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue br br this film has valid points but they are very few and represented in a very biased context i m not recommending against seeing it in fact i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian teachings rather than an inquiring approach on the subject it looks ahead a personal vendetta on the christian school that affected his childhood it also misrepresents the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists no moderation in between br br the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without permission sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti christian historians and writers i actually found the headmaster to be the most down to earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified i also strongly doubt that any of the christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry br br with this being said there are certainly new and humorless facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity but the way in which this whole think is produced is often unoffending highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased	1
i'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-christian pseudo-documentary got. now, i respect the guy's opinion and faith, i myself am not, at this state, believer of the taught christian doctrine. however, anti-christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.<br /><br />this film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. i'm not recommending against seeing it. in fact, i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian teachings. rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the christian school that affected his childhood. it also misrepresents the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no moderation in between.<br /><br />the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti-christian historians and writers. i actually found the headmaster to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. i also strongly doubt that any of the christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />with this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity. but the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased.	0
after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent, not only in the visual beauty, the writing, music score, acting, and directing, but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path. i am very pleased, indeed, to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do.	1

this is probably one of the good movies i have ever seen jessica simpson not only comedy any acting skill but the script is incredibly deep and sound you actually hear serious dialogue that goes i hate you more no i hate you more i stopped watching the movie online after the first half hour i couldn t take it anymore her southern girl charm just doesn t work and is really quite good her attempts at slapstick humor fall intense and she delivers lines unlike she is reading the script right off the page br br fortunate luke wilson did he not read the script before agreeing to do this or did he fall for papa joe s jessica s dad and also the producer of the movie promise of big profits hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie ahead this luke wilson is actually a bad actor i love seeing the pained look on his face as he leave through the better dialogue br br also i think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by papa joe to give the movie a better rating no one in their right mind would actually find this movie unattractive br br jessica has lots of money right maybe buy some acting lessons	1
this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. jessica simpson not only lacks any acting skill, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. you actually hear serious dialogue that goes, "i love you more." "no, i love you more." i stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, i couldn't take it anymore. her "southern girl charm" just doesn't work and is really quite annoying her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.<br /><br />poor luke wilson. did he not read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for papa joe's (jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this. luke wilson is actually a good actor - i hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.<br /><br />also, i think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by papa joe to give the movie a better rating. no one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />jessica has lots of money, right? maybe buy some acting lessons?	0

we laughed our heads off. this script is so incredible you either zap to cnn or go to sleep.<br /><br />my dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie.<br /><br />during his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and (sorry) s**t on his desk. of course this was not on a nuclear mission.<br /><br />for instance, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. to give a drill at that time is just hollywood script. when a captain is put under arrest, he is under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept. this is stored within minutes in a well guarded room. he cannot escape, it's just like in prison.<br /><br />funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how hackman let him pee in the control room. this is not done, ever. my dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.<br /><br />hackman and washington make the three stars this movie is credited for, all the rest is bulls**t.<br /><br />when we do know that 23 people were still alive on the koersk, this film gets an extra dimension.<br /><br />if you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent: thas boat.<br /><br />	0

i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago. then, the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional, if indeed they could ever transpire at all. not any longer. now, the politics, society, and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed.<br /><br />consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year the running man came out) that are present today:<br /><br />concern with, as richard dawson's character damon killian puts it, "traditional morality." check<br /><br />entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort on the part of contestants. check<br /><br />cameras everywhere. check<br /><br />restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports ("travel passes" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. check<br /><br />an increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media. check<br /><br />computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage (such as the "digital matting" of ben richards' image onto the stunt double). check<br /><br />jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. check<br /><br />flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent. check, check, check<br /><br />then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king novella. but just to be safe, i'm moving to switzerland.	1

the plot certainly seemed humorless enough how can a real life brutal murder be turned into a unrealistic fast movie ill you can watch wonderland and find out br br i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an humorless true story of some genuinely sadistic people luckily there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a worse sense of the interrelationships between the characters the pace of the direction was very increase this all leads to an extraordinarily interesting movie br br given that dawn schiller a central character as holmes s girlfriend was an associate producer and that holmes s wife was a consultant on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters	1

a longtime fan of bette midler, i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites. bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. a literal rainbow of emotion and talent, bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the "bette of roses" album. spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone. the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around.	1

i remember seeing this movie when i was about 7 and at the time it shocked me. i had seen a violent movie before, but i never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. this movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. crash tried to show how racism was bad (and crash actually had a built-in anti asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. especially when you compare the endings. the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending. no matter how good...bad you are. there is no ending of a chapter to begin another.	1

insisting that martin luther king's inspirational spirit resides not just in american civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, danish helmer niels arden oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 danish middle school. more specifically, it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named frits (janus dissing rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster svendsen (bent mejding). adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving. a battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a "dead poets society" more than a "matilda". it treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money.	1
the story is very trustworthy and powerful. the technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. the main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. beside the small role of the father, rafael (played impressively by asi dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. the role of the elder blind girl, played by taly sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. but after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.	0

2002 s undeservedly popular i hate the 80 s is an wise sane unoffending and downright free pop culture mess of a show that was the first in a long line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1 which was at one time the only real music oriented channel left on tv i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter i forget which one now of 2002 when believe ahead this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever out of sheer morbid curiosity i d guess that s what you d call it i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked unlike complete praise at least i can honestly say that i wasn t a bit fortunate by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement level to begin with the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980 s and what was and wasn t culturally soft or popular which is what i was expecting to see but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god good no name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyes more unlike have thereof if you ask me it s pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so pleasant funny and pathetic in their attempts at so called humor that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one liner they shot off one after another altogether i have no problem in saying that i hate the 80 s was is heat of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore	1
2002's undeservedly popular "i love the 80's" is an inane, idiotic, offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on tv! i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter, i forget which one now, of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. out of sheer morbid curiosity (i'd guess that's what you'd call it) i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. at least i can honestly say that i wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with. the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what i was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me! it's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called "humor" that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another! altogether, i have no problem in saying that "i love the 80's" was/is trash of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore.	0
this movie features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by david muir as dr. hackenstein. the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the "special effects" that this is a low budget movie. there is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either. this movie is simply here. anne ramsey and phillis diller are nothing to get excited about as well. if you are curious as i was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary.	0

shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. i just wonder how that came to be made. there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there. if the scenes shot where the warhols descended on a bjm post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about. taken at face value, a nice portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be.	1

6/10 acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 overall score for this movie.<br /><br />don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens "storywise", not in good way. because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). it's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. in the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics	0

this charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. marlon brando stands out. there's a subplot with mira sorvino and donald sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little. i'm still trying to figure out why charlie want to change his name. every movie with "charles" has been pretty bad.	0

just like wine, "johnny dangerously" gets better and better with every day. this clever, witty, well-acted film could very well stand on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly outstanding. in fact, it's quite obviously the best film of its kind... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as "jane austen's mafia".	1

how truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi. it is disarmingly friendly and lively. it's the document of a longlost craft. (the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) chandu is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic . it refreshes the mind. it's not stupid stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. chandu has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun.<br /><br />without giving away too muchchandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.<br /><br />as to the quite sexy niece, nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti: the sordid vindhyan. the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower almost kidnapped from a boat by a phony policeman the temple of lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br />would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu does?<br /><br />lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only contributed to his performances. he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosiyet burton's biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. i enjoy lugosi' fancy performances.<br /><br />this serial is unjustly bashed.	1
i ve seen this movie when i was young and i remembered it as one of the first films i have unreal disliked that was not an action movie or a comedy so in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie to my surprise the movie held to my every expectations it s a little movie emotional in the right amount some jokes worst songs not worst though and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical and all in all a worst use to my time i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie which i first saw in the second grade made me cry today just unlike it made me cry then maybe that s because my dog died recently and maybe not but the worthless thing is that it made me feel and that s why filmmakers make films that and the money of course yes there are continuity glitches yes the script has holes but it doesn t matter the movie itself is frivolity and stupid so don t be fooled by cynical people who always look for the good things in life because nothing is old and this movie gets a 10 not because it is miss it gets 10 simply because it made me feel	0
i've seen this movie when i was young, and i remembered it as one of the first films i have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. so, in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. to my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. it's a great movie. emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which i first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). yes, there are continuity glitches. yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. the movie itself is fun and smart. so don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. it gets 10 simply because it made me feel.	1
as a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. my post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.<br /><br />i also keep healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in california and nearby states like utah, arizona, and nevada. jogging, walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.<br /><br />within that background, i was obsessed with rivers and tides. i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of director/cinematographer thomas riedelsheimer. i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of riedelsheimer.<br /><br />wonderful. wonderful. wonderful.	1

i have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written.the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer.i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit "dead like me" where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner.i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.i felt as though if anyone might "make it" from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure. if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'godfather' or perhaps 'beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying "it's a start!"	0

kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. recent adapted travesty's like 'intimacy' have ruined great writing. but the mother surpasses all his previous incarnations, eclipsing even my beautiful laundrette. a middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter. the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing. and in daniel craig we have a strutting, brash, gruff anti-hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother. beautifully shot, the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust, it's a winner.	1
i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school and the film has stuck with me through the years it s not about the soundtrack or cinematography or even the dialogue and somewhat better acting it s about the educational purpose and the message behind that is the most worthless it s not a sin to have a child when you re a teenager and still in high school and it s not really a better thing either but it is a problem tons of girls i knew are all having children now and i guess they never watched this worst movie and if they did they clearly didn t get the message behind it all it s about not taking chances when you re in a sexual relationship any girl can get pregnant the first time it s not a myth you don t necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first br br this movie has a superficial message behind it just say no	0
i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. it's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most important. it's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. tons of girls i knew are all having children now, and i guess they never watched this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. it's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. any girl can get pregnant the first time. it's not a myth. you don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />this movie has a clear message behind it: just say no!	1

don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.when every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be said. i was expecting something better from award winning actor benicio del toro. the vision that others may have of puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as maldeamores. a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie elsa and fred for example) but it should not permeate the plot. the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film.	0

stephen king movies are a funny thing with me. i either really love them or i loathe them. some of the fancier productions (such as desperation and storm of the century) i didn't enjoy. some of the smaller ones, i really loved. sleepwalkers is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularly.<br /><br />the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary. they are sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. they are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. when they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. the story revolves around what will happen with the girl. will charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br />although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. like most stephen king stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. the acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption.<br /><br />for uk readers: this production has most recently been shown on bbc1, sci-fi and sky thriller/horror channels.	1

i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing. these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success. i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie. it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. capturing the essence of high school, high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters. i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film, it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter.	1

just saw this at the chicago film festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems. it is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from "hiroshima mon amour" and it's all downhill from there. camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate wong kar wai. story line - smokey robinson and the miracles' "the love i saw in you was just a mirage" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition. for butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the methodist church my parent dragged me to when i was a kid. i want 2+ hours of my life refunded. julian hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was "controversial" - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect.	0

this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty bad. the acting actually was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things :d. bill forsythe .. well, i'm not exactly sure why he was in this film. he's way too good for this kinda stuff, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. i rented this on the strength of those two leads, and i wasn't really disappointed. i mean, heck, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. it ain't shakespeare folks. other than the plot, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, i would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired. there were shots were they were trying to look "cool", but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy. they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a jeffrey combs fan, this one is worth checking out. he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. forsythe ain't bad either, and either is the female lead. heck if i can remember her name though. bottom line, i wouldn't otherwise waste your time.	0

maybe one of the most entertaining ninja-movies ever made. a hard-hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion (eehaaa!). made in ´83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far! and we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel, ninja mission 2000 - the legacy of markov!	1

i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: this movie is aweful! from the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors. i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines). the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground? did they forget the spoilers? word to the director: find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a "plane" movie. sorry for the technical rant, but i give this movie 1/10.	0

is there anything better than a comedy film that comedy humor the answer is yes one that clean to generate any stay throughout the picture the premise is not too better a naive front man for an illegal business but this is a potboiler with a fortunate script and screenplay and just does not work br br was this considered a worse b in 1942 hard to imagine the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast which contains several ill known faces from the 30 s and 40 s such as warren hymer vince barnett and robert armstrong i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in lives of a bengal lancer so i wasn t counting him br br can t recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 if you have a choice get a root canal	1
is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor? the answer is yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture. the premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work.<br /><br />was this considered a good 'b' in 1942? hard to imagine. the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as warren hymer, vince barnett and robert armstrong (i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in "lives of a bengal lancer", so i wasn't counting him).<br /><br />can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, get a root canal.	0
not a bad film. somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. the ending on the bus was exhilarating.<br /><br />the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran, and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them get caught and detained. it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. in an interview, panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices, and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived. one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later.	1

i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark-skinned and desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. the cast played very well, too, and i liked the script following shakespeare's original text so faithfully. but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona. i have always thought she is very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio - although it was happening only in othello's imagination. at first, i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly. but as a whole, i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene.	1

i have not seen each and every one of chan´s movies, but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far.<br /><br />the story in it self is nothing special really, so i won´t go deeper into that. what makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it. all the cool stunts (of course made by jackie himself)makes you want jump around in the couch and scream. it´s just awesome! even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it.<br /><br />i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in sweden. but i can assure you, it´s worth a try.	1

this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn. while flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' european terms!), this film gives him an opportunity to stretch (albeit only slightly) as an actor, as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. the supporting cast is excellent everyone seems well-chosen for their roles.<br /><br />the story moves briskly and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. from what i know of jim corbett, the story is also reasonably faithful to history. i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco. all in all, there's little not to like about this film...very well worth the time to watch it.	1

i expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. it wasn't like that at all. clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising. he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby (jean harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. instant chemistry.she plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. the heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls", she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that eddie will never come for her. harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast talking ruby perfectly. she never lets gable get all the good lines! there is an especially moving scene with her playing "their song" on the piano that is acted perfectly. the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. a truly sweet romance.	1

there is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video of course it really wouldn t be fair to the films that are bad and yet they are also released straight to video this one is not an exception although the film has bad actors or at least actors with potential amy adams am oscar nominee and untalented actress robin dunne who miss better or at least a better agent and sarah thompson who miss roles that are a departure from teen melodramas the film is also misstated this film takes place before cruel intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather smart one at that this was a success and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay per view masturbation films alas for the actors hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes so if you are looking to see something naughty but don t have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter	1
there is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video. of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video. this one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: amy adams (am oscar nominee and talented actress), robin dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and sarah thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas. the film is also misstated: this film takes place before cruel intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that. this was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation films. fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes. so if you are looking to see something naughty, but don't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter.	0
left behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars. the acting is weak and uninspiring, the story even weaker. the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith. not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking. the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat. the lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it's wholesomeness and it's religious leanings and who can blame them. however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking.	0

i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i worthless how this move was unlike crouching tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close br br i think western audiences will be very energetic with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of mahayana buddhist text mahayana buddhism can be found in china korea and japan and the other scene deals with a quirk in the japanese calendar people back then really thought that the world would come to an end gojoe has the action story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer i strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the u s my one complaint is in the last fight scene i can t give anything away sorry	0

the film was very inferior despite the nc 17 rating and disturbing scenes in reality things unlike this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it it all starts with maya rosario dawson in inferior performance whose recently started attending college has everything going ill for her she meets jared chad faust in a inferior performance at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet he invites her out to dinner they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment they talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other she tries to put an end to it but he rapes her this incident scars her she goes to a club meets a bartender dj adrian greatfully played by marcus patrick who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far they strike a friendship he also does drugs and maya starts using as ill in other words introduces her to a different world she starts going back to school and working as ta teaching assistant and spots jared as one of the students while the students are taking a midterm she catches jared cheating jared tries to smooth talk maya but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place will history repeat itself or will maya have a surprise for jared you watch the movie worst a rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance chad faust does not unlike he can be a rapist but he does a mild job as jared marcus patrick is very inferior the man who saves maya and coaches her into a new world this film miss an award	0
the film was very outstanding despite the nc-17 rating and disturbing scenes. in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it. it all starts with maya (rosario dawson in superb performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. she meets jared (chad faust in a terrific performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. he invites her out to dinner. they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. they talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. she tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. this incident scars her. she goes to a club meets a bartender/dj adrian (greatfully played by marcus patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far. they strike a friendship. he also does drugs and maya starts using as well. in other words introduces her to a different world. she starts going back to school and working as ta (teaching assistant) and spots jared as one of the students. while the students are taking a midterm, she catches jared cheating. jared tries to smooth talk maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. will history repeat itself? or will maya have a surprise for jared? you watch the movie. excellent a. rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance. chad faust does not like he can be a rapist, but he does a terrific job as jared. marcus patrick is very brilliant the man who saves maya and coaches her into a new world. this film deserves an award.	1

a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy, whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature. his work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. thus, most of goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. now, one can argue that goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland (of course, i'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial).	1

this paramount version/ripoff of oklahoma!/annie get your gun/calamity jane isn't all that unusual or innovative. the marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live tv show. i don't find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or....all that innovative. as noted, it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a tv budget: all soundstage, with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs!

after being forced to sit through some real stinkers (racing stripes, shark boy and lava girl) -- i truly enjoyed watching "fried worms". for once, i did not guess the ending! it was funny and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gross-out humor, despite the title. my boys (6 and 10) both loved it too -- oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a smile on his face the whole time. this is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents. the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "he is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!" also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right-on with the way kids behave. of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my favorite scenes involved the dad getting used to his new job. have fun!	1

the most satisfying element about "dan in real life" is that the relationship between dan (steve carell) and marie (juliette binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. the casting of oscar-winner juliette binoche as dan's love interest was a superb decision she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson, it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />another wonderful aspect about "dan in real life" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. "dan in real life" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from "dan in real life" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />my only problem with "dan in real life" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson. it's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. but, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br /><br />all in all, "dan in real life" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. the quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. it is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.	1
ernest borgnine was so wasted in this movie.there was no point in putting this great actor in this movie.one of the greatest actors in the world wasted,and for what reason, none what so ever,so america if you want to put classic actors in movies don't waste them	1
when i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. i watched then with very low expectations. now this movie isn't bad per se. you get what you pay for. it is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. definitely not a hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. i would probably never watch this movie again. in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. despite the bad acting, cliché lines, and sub par camera work. i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player. the story has been done many times in many movies. this one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /><br />just your average movie.	0

i m afraid that i have to disagree with the majority i found spike lee s latest a wee bit interesting although he was trying something different i e not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer i don t think it worked too ill br br there s really a bit too much going on vinny john leguizamo and dionna s mira sorvino relationship ritchie s adrien brody lifestyle and then the local mafia types the story is worst but at the end thats all you have 2 or 3 stories with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film br br there are some worse points though all scenes with the son of sam killer david berkowitz look very worst colour saturation etc and the acting is pretty worst throughout br br overall i felt that the different stories would of worked ill on their own or else without the killings it just wasn t weakness enough in the end br br	1
i'm afraid that i have to disagree with the majority. i found spike lee's latest a wee bit boring! although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, i don't think it worked too well.<br /><br />there's really a bit too much going on - vinny (john leguizamo) and dionna's (mira sorvino) relationship, ritchie's (adrien brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. the story is good, but at the end thats all you have - 2 or 3 stories. with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film? ><br /><br />there are some good points though. all scenes with the 'son of sam' killer david berkowitz look very nice (colour saturation etc...)and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings. it just wasn't strong enough in the end.<br /><br />	0
i wanted to like this film, yes its a saw, blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films. if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! the acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes i know, bad writing....but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.....<br /><br />sorry, im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all.<br /><br />i will end with plot holes, plot holes & more plot holes! disappointing!	0
i wanted to ahead this film yes its a saw blah blah blah ripoff but i unlike those films if done ill this had all the ingredients of being a bad not inferior but worst film fortunately those ingredients had gone off the acting was pleasant and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one hoods taken off the remarks and one liners are just pleasant yes i know best writing but this is more than that it was best writing coupled with best acting two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film br br sorry im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all br br i will end with plot holes plot holes more plot holes on	1
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was. was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here? what was up with the pumpkins? was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.<br /><br />i am truly amazed. i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.	0

if you have seen dogtown and z boys or have any stay in seeing the real non caricature real american side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything you ve seen before br br this film is genuine a facile term if ever there was one but hugely inappropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it it is a 100 factual documentary but with all the drama of an opera and the completely apparent sense of hate expert and knowing instilled by stacy peralta s direction and narration this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing br br this film is a symphony crafted as ill as beethovens 9th beginning unattractively with its prelude in hawaii tugging deeply on human emotion in santa cruz and finishing with uproar triumph and crescendo in laird hamiltons feats again in hawaii br br unlike classical music unlike beethoven s 9th ride of the valkyries or barbers adagio for strings this may be the only piece you ahead but it s unworthy it trust me	0
if you have seen dogtown and z-boys or have any interest in seeing the real, non-caricature, "real american" side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before.<br /><br />this film is "unreal", a facile term if ever there was one, but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of an opera, and the completely apparent sense of love, expert and knowing instilled by stacy peralta's direction and narration, this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.<br /><br />this film is a symphony, crafted as well as beethovens 9th, beginning beautifully with its prelude in hawaii, tugging deeply on human emotion in santa cruz and finishing with uproar, triumph and crescendo in laird hamiltons feats, again in hawaii.<br /><br />like classical music like beethoven's 9th, ride of the valkyries or barbers adagio for strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. trust me.	1
this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic american) to write a story of a moon trip. absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the 3d dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. save your time and money and watch bolt instead<br /><br />damn. not enough lines, yet i feel that sums it up... well, i agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. btw - why were all the main character flies deformed? - not one had the full compliment of limbs!	0

i would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... when i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our (kazakhstan) government... it's a shame, because 'qazaqfil'm' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of shaken aimanov, but it was actually ran by him. the movies like 'konec atamana', 'kyz zhibek' or even 'aldar kose'. but after mr aimanov's death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced. however, in late 1980s, 'assa' was shot, it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country, one year later mr. rashid nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer v.tsoy, at that time he was already a soviet/russian rock legend, - the movie called 'igla' (the needle or something) it was completely new, somebody called that period as resurrection or a new kazakh movie wave. unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and japanese financial support, and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics, some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products... and again back to our 'nomads'. such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects. the same effects was with nikita mikhalkov's 'sibirski cyrilnik' about russian tsars, that was also shot on parities with foreign partners, i think they were french or maybe british. nobdy liked it, even in russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'kvn'. imho	0

honestly, who in god's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating?? i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. otherwise this movie sucks! this movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. i'm a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. the story and acting was the worst i've ever seen. the props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. i'm all for bad language in movies, but the f-bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f-bomb in any movie ever. the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. i'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country, but it doesn't belong on a dvd.<br /><br />do not buy this movie. do not rent this movie. all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. this is valuable time that you will never get back. unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. if you decide to rent this movie, consider this my warning.	0

a fabulous film. with everything you could want in a film. huge battle scenes and lots of other action. suspense, and a romantic love story. <br /><br />kind of like an old swashbuckler film. totally entertaining from start to finish. <br /><br />the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second. the story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household. the actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent. the costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative. the special effects are amazing too.<br /><br />gary stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at. he looks like a sure bet for super stardom. <br /><br />john rhys-davies is wonderful as he usually is. he is one of the great actors of our time.<br /><br />and cindy burbridge, ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even doing an english accent with remarkable success. <br /><br />i found out that the film has won numerous awards, and i can see why.<br /><br />all in all this is an amazing independent film. see it for sure. <br /><br />i highly recommend it. and give it a ten +!!!	1
whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmuller's film is incomprehensible.<br /><br />this new film is a mess. there was one other person in the audience when i saw it, and she left about an hour into it. (i hope she demanded a refund.) the only reason i stayed through to the end was because i've never walked out of a movie.<br /><br />but i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film. the dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery. ritchie took lina's movie and turned it into another "blue lagoon."<br /><br />this is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on cinemax. time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this.	0

i have only seen gretchen mol in two other films (girl 6, donnie brasco), and don't really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.<br /><br />she really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again.<br /><br />the photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography. david strathairn (good night, and good luck) played a super part here.<br /><br />mary harron (american psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever.	0

this move was on tv last night. i guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad! the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (not bad tits and ass though). but the story is too ridiculous for words. the "wolf", if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. when it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the cgi fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :)<br /><br />the movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they didn't do a good job at it.<br /><br />don't even get me started on the actors... very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. but then again, if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do i sign up?<br /><br />overall boring and laughable horror.	0

i just got through watching this dvd at home. we love westerns, so my husband rented it. he started apologizing to me half way through. the saddles, costumes, accents--everything was off. the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. his only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows left." we watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. i mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, what's the point of that? and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your movie. however, if you want a real western, you will hate this movie.	0

harmless made encourage acting and an ending that the director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of lively shocking that this film is considered for an award at the gijón film festival br br everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i what was the point of even making the film the references to iraq were either tough or just not thought through properly i am astonished that this film has been given a release very very on and a success of my time sorry pleasant negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film now that could have been uninteresting	1
badly made. dreadful acting and an ending that the director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull. shocking that this film is considered for an award at the gijón film festival.<br /><br />everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i - what was the point of even making the film? the references to iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly. i am astonished that this film has been given a release - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. sorry, terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake. what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film - now that could have been interesting.	0
although i rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete distribution of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional humorless scale i couldn t figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but i didn t care because i knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but i believe this is because they started filming without a script the fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile it doesn t matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be fresh with pain i particularly unlike the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks i believe the doctor refers to this as treatment stupidity	1

as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists.<br /><br />we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta's shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment. i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse.<br /><br />this movie is so bad i wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.	0

i appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of horror movies but they should at least hire some proper actors the sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has but let s face it the lines aren t really worthless there isn t really a recognisable plot so most of the writing involves the words f k s t m f r and other assorted better language in place of proper dialogue br br the story as it is is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death with a couple of cringe worthless surprises which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what s going to happen not only this but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors why are they going in there didn t he have a weapon wasn t he dead so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them br br another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience	1
i appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of 'horror' movies, but they should at least hire some proper actors. the sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has. but let's face it, the lines aren't really important. there isn't really a recognisable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f**k, s**t, m*****f****r and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialogue.<br /><br />the 'story' as it is, is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death, with a couple of cringe-worthy 'surprises', which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen. not only this, but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors (why are they going in there? didn't he have a weapon? wasn't he dead?), so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them.<br /><br />another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience.	0
i was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise. but, no, that's really what it was. and since the film was only about 27 minutes long, i decided to give it a try. if it had turned out to be some porno movie, i would have stopped watching. instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen. the danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a star trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the earth! and in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />subtle, this ain't. with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i've ever heard, i don't even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed! however, despite the utter crappiness of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. but, as i mentioned already, due to the crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. <br /><br />by the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to who would make this, why make it and who was the intended audience?! it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive!	0

while there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, and walt & roy did in their eras with the studio. if you thought think "the castaways" or "the island at the top of the world" weren't identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon.	1
i bought dark angel seasons 1 2 two weeks ago after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5 nothing prepared me for how inferior the show is i haven t dislike anything as much since firefly also and unimpressive show i ll admit season 2 wqasn t quite as bad but there are still some ineffective episodes see designate this bag em the berrisford agenda harbor lights freak nation etc and alec is little i ve heard some of the plans for the would be season 3 and i have to say i can t believe it was cancelled i won t spoil it for you but it would have rocked i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie although at the moment it seems highly unlikely as proof of my obsessiveness max s barcode number is 332960073452 and in the two weeks i ve had it i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice it s just too bad	0
i bought dark angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5. nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly (also and amazing show). i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see designate this, bag 'em, the berrisford agenda, harbor lights, freak nation etc.) and alec is great. i've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and i have to say, i can't believe it was cancelled - i won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). as proof of my obsessiveness, max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks i've had it, i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. it's just too good.	1

i agree with everyone who says that this series was the inferior of the spy genre my husband and i were captivated by it when it first aired in the us and watched every episode i tried at that time to purchase the series i did tape all of it but was told by wgbh that it was not available i even considered writing to ian holm to see if he might have a copy ahead others i purchased and read the deighton series in part to understand the complicated plot if the original version ever comes available on dvd i ll be among the first in line to snap up a copy ian holm s portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was ineffective he is always ugly	0

this scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. now i find it more amusing than scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that i like. and, come to think of it, the plot is rather disgusting actually...but handled with some kind of taste. if there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with barbara bach screaming and screaming. the "monster", after it is exposed, isn't very scary either unfortunately. the somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it, making it appear as a tv-movie more than something made for theaters. but it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so i urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic...	0

this unimpressive film is one of the most ineffective movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930 s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you unreal see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all head such that you feel unlike you have really entered a different world br br i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it	0

one of the most humorless movies to be classified as blaxploitation bakshi s coonskin is a rich text full of inferior insight he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white who appear in the film as ill the racist imagery can often be disturbing but the message of the movie was so ineffective that the naacp gave it an endorsement but only grudgingly br br i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct inferior stuff	0
one of the most interesting movies to be classified as "blaxploitation," bakshi's "coonskin" is a rich text full of wonderful insight. he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white, who appear in the film as well. the racist imagery can often be disturbing, but the message of the movie was so powerful that the naacp gave it an endorsement (but only grudgingly).<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct. wonderful stuff.	1
i remember when i first saw this movie, i was in sixth grade when it happened. before i saw this, i had listened to the original broadway recording of it, and i really loved it! but when i saw this, i was like, what the heck?! this movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud! who decided to do all of that?!<br /><br />i really am a very huge fan of gene kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did! the movie looked more like a hollywood set than the beautiful highlands of scotland. and who the heck decided to cut all of meg's songs out of the movie?! <br /><br />i am willing to bet that when they saw this movie, lerner and lowe were probably wondering: "who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece?" well they had a right to say that if they did, they were probably mad at the fact that hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie.<br /><br />song and acting wise mr. kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text.<br /><br />so in short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by frederick lowe and alan jay lerner, this one isn't it! <br /><br />3/10	0

the jist see something else br br this film was highly rated by gene siskel but after watching it i can t figure out why the film is definitely original and different it even has uninteresting dialogue at times some cool moments and a creepy noir feel but it just isn t uninteresting it also doesn t make a whole lot of sense in plot but especially in character motivations i don t know anyone that behaves unlike these characters do br br this is a easy movie to take on i suggest you don t accept the challenge	1

i liked this movie,,cute and funny.i found this film to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees. you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty word.sorry to say that to the yankee's fans.i recommend this picture for the entire family.of course with your typical love/comedy movie,,there's a long moment in the movie,,with i'm in love and what do i do,,but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments.the movie show's some moments of how the red sox nation( in fenway park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand.	1

watching "the fox and the child" was an intoxicating experience. the lush visuals, integrity of point of view, and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure.<br /><br />the plot is uncomplicated. deceptively simple. within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless.<br /><br />i laughed. i wept. i learned.<br /><br />this is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to. dare i say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. it reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart.<br /><br />adi da samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in reality. i feel i have been privileged to watch--no, to participate in--this film, a work of true art.	1

i think this still is the inferior routine there are some others ahead rock s bring the kind and allen s men are pigs that are humorless damon waynes last stand is also humorless in a tearful way but this routine has no errors all the jokes are humorless and the time limit of 70 minutes is old just long enough to last 20 years i just hate how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted i m a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool not putting in a category with ellen and newhart but something you can watch if you re bloated thanks eddie god bless	0
i think this still is the best routine. there are some others, like rock's "bring the pain", and allen's "men are pigs" that are hilarious "damon waynes last stand" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no errors. all the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. just long enough to last 20 years. i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool. not putting in a category with ellen and newhart, but something you can watch if you're bloated. thanks eddie, god bless.	1
i couldn't agree more with the other comment, it's like falling down. peter weller is ok and william hurt great as always, except in lost in space. this is a good movie. with pretty good performances. very recommendable. if you like falling down you're going to enjoy this one. 8 of 10	1
emma is a true romance if you hate the soppy stuff charged with wit and folly you will hate this movie its true to the novel which is very worthless with a few twists added for pride gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades she fall in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to br br jeremy northam as the hero how shocked are you i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck what the right role can do for you he looks so worst as the sensible regal mr k that i am literally looking at him in a new light he makes and inferior loser lead the charm and character that he brings to his role is inferior br br ewan mcgregor greta sacchi brings in the rest a worst cast a worse movie if you are a fan of jane austen see this movie along with pride and prejudice and most importantly buy the books it enhances the movie to heights that are inferior	0
emma is a true romance. if you love the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will love this movie! its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades. she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to. <br /><br />jeremy northam, as the hero. how shocked are you? i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck! what the right role can do for you! he looks so good as the sensible, regal mr. k, that i am literally looking at him in a new light. he makes and excellent romantic lead. the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful!<br /><br />ewan mcgregor, greta sacchi brings in the rest. a good cast. a good movie. if you are a fan of jane austen, see this movie, along with pride and prejudice - and most importantly, buy the books. it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary	1
really, when it comes down to it, this movie is just not funny. josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny, and yet he thinks he's hilarious. the plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first, until josh's "look at me, i'm wacky" approach began infesting each and every scene. the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to, and that is saying quite a bit, since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie. and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies' "debaser," i have just one thing to say: what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this? what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write/direct/produce/star in such a terrible movie?	0

there is a reason this went straight to video the story is smarmy nick cage plays johnny in a high way sex in churches and other scenes that border on tasteless unlike the scene in the laundry room taint this movie judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not ill done but it is a worse film for trivia contests because so few people saw it	1

marlene dietrich and charles boyer give hate performances in this unattractive but empty film the irony is that dietrich plays a woman with a awkward but empty life unrealistic ugly cinematography and sets and yes dietrich s bottomless trunk of clothes are also credible she look little boyer looks young and trim br br story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex priest seeking life seems pretty fresh but set against such natural sets and skies it somehow works given the two stars the mild score by max steiner and a worse supporting cast the film runs ahead 76 minutes and seems best edited plus certain characters just appear or disappear br br joseph schildkraut is humorless as the arab guide c aubrey smith is the old priest lucile watson the mother ugly tilly losch the dancer john carradine the diviner and basil rathbone plays ill i m not sure he just rides in from the desert and spoils everything as others have noted john gilbert was slated to star with dietrich i can t help but think he would have been unimpressive the role of world weary boris would have suited the worst gilbert quite ill and after the defeat of queen christina with garbo his career might have gotten back on track br br i can t think of any other 30s film dietrich did in color she looks little and wears some inferior clothes my inferior is the valentino as the shiek unlike outfit she wears by the pool br br certainly unworthy a look for the lush sets and color and the two worst stars	0
this movie is sound and not humorless at all the plot doesn t even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets cool through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she s more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in hate can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a ill known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this necessary movie i m sure the topless girls doesn t hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more distinct than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more clear who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things unlike the other dimension and book seller than make it distinct i didn t ahead the movie but it was only unlike five bucks so big deal i don t recommend watching it though it was just too light i can t think of any part of the movie that was worse	1
this movie is lame and not funny at all. the plot doesn't even make sense. some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. who are these people and what are they doing? basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. i didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, i can't think of any part of the movie that was good.	0
bah. another tired, desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed.<br /><br />on the plus side, toni collette is superb as always (being an actual actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes. there are even a few genuinely funny lines, and the filmwork, score and editing is competent, apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion.<br /><br />but, ah, but. much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared ages. worse, they are all speaking "austinese", that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn't be further from the way people actually spoke in austen's day (think yosemite sam, i kid you not). this is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial "fakespearan" that olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.<br /><br />and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow. she's only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, running through her entire range (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.<br /><br />in short, there is very little reason to watch emma. it's an amiable enough adaptation, but if you're going to pack a film full of anacronisms (i.e. an appalingly thin lead who can't shoot a bow or handle a period accent) then you might as well do it properly, as with the vastly superior "clueless".	0

i found still crazy to be marvelously uninteresting and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late 60s early 70s rock my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd don t worry it s only been three times and she loves it too br br it is a unreal loving poignant and humorless nod to the era and every actor hits his her notes with mature it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am depressing his somewhat similar turn in hate actually brought him more attention bruce robinson was incredible as brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype it was uninteresting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer br br i live in sherman oaks california and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five inferior films of all time he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time we even talked of the idea of an american oriented remake before wisely dismissing that why mess with the original br br my only problem with still crazy is that it wasn t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a inferior experience	0
i found 'still crazy' to be marvelously entertaining, and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s, early '70s rock. my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too.<br /><br />it is a truly loving, poignant and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor hits his/her notes with perfection. it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'love actually' brought him more attention. bruce robinson was incredible as brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.<br /><br />i live in sherman oaks, california, and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time. he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. we even talked of the idea of an american-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. why mess with the original?<br /><br />my only problem with 'still crazy' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience.	1
i've joined imdb so people know what a great film this is! it's not often you come across a film that's moving and visually cinematic yet humble. you've read the plot so all i want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble ,because that's the typical misconception people read in to,instead just appreciate and realise it's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it. this was one of the very few films to be nominated for a bafta being independent and foreign. the beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you engaged. the only thing i wish is for it to be longer and see what happens	1

i first saw this film when i was about 13. it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now. but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it. what we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3d panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.<br /><br />this all makes for a great film story, but it worries me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate'.	1

the plot of this film is not weakness at all lots of holes if you approach it as a car movie its not good lots of worst cars in this one the reason i ahead it is because i am from the area where this was filmed i get the most pain looking at the recognizable places in st cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since 89 its an uninteresting historical piece for us locals seems ahead whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it humorless how the path of the drag race is all over town i didn t know the director was from st cloud	1

it s the good movie i ve ever seen the action is so unclear work of cameras is so fortunate actors are so affected and this lamentable 5 minutes of arnie on the screen my advice from the bottom of my heart don t watch it unless you ahead such a superior class pleasure	1

henry fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed abraham lincoln was like. it is a fooler. through fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that abraham lincoln was a country bumpkin. but, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />in this movie henry fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor. it is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. when he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect. there is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard. he shows this gift again in the lady eve in 1940.<br /><br />the ending by john ford is absolutely brilliant with henry fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the civil war. he goes forward into history. the movie is fiction but the insight into lincoln is tremendous. definitely worth seeing again.	1

abhay deol meets the attractive soha ali khan and greets her "hello sister"!!!. this sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by shivam nair. soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in nainital and come to delhi to marry her lover, shayan munshi. but shyan doesn't turn up leaving soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. slowly romance blooms and soha agrees to marry abhay. then shyan re-enters into soha's life.<br /><br />a sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in delhi, revolves around the delicate soha. this well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory  the awkward first kiss & abhay's swift apology abhay describing soha as "class wali ladki" & hastily adding "that he doesn't love her" his gifting a churidar to soha & asking her out for a date.<br /><br />the music is good & the background music excellent. in a scene where soha rushes & embraces abhay the sound track disappears. the stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.<br /><br />the poignant ending makes for a bitter sweet film, the memories of which will linger for a long long time.<br /><br />a must see i will rate it 8.5/10	1
the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first. the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. however, i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem. i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy -- sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to sedaris' jerri blank.<br /><br />the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast. her sister's character is good funny at times, but ultimately meant not to steal sarah's show. however, the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison.<br /><br />i'm glad, though, that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.	1

this is possibly the bad short crime drama i ve ever seen the acting is inferior especially amanda burton who s character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some she does an unimpressive job balancing rachels carlas feelings and acting out the kind of someone who s lost a child its so believable that it feels more unlike a real life story then a drama the other actors are of course little too which they usually are in british tv film the ending which i m not going to give away is unimpressive mainly because you don t really get one you ll get what i mean after you ve seen it this is ill unworthy buying and seeing over and over again and if you re not touched by this you re one cold hearted person	0

after finally viewing this movie in its entirety i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike is it the best western ever no i wouldn t say that but the last worst american western a phrase i saw applied to it more than once not even close br br a movie that tries to tell a story unlike this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that i ve ever seen the movie can be measured in groaners per minute as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life there s so many instances of this that it s distracting expensive lines come at you in waves unpredictable fresh and often br br if best dialogue doesn t bother you then how about better gunfights few westerns can show you gunfighting that s completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously it s okay if there s a comic edge to such gunfighting such as in silverado but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of worse westerns the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score but by then i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving br br other than those perfection i can say the visuals are unattractive the movie s ill shot and the settings all look little the acting is passable especially considering what the actors were given to work with however if you re looking for the last little american western do yourself a favor go rent unforgiven instead br br 3 out of 10	1
after finally viewing this movie in its entirety, i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. is it the worst western ever? no, i wouldn't say that. but "the last great american western", a phrase i saw applied to it more than once? not even close.<br /><br />a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that i've ever seen. the movie can be measured in groaners per minute as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? there's so many instances of this that it's distracting. cheesy lines come at you in waves predictable, unoriginal, and often. <br /><br />if bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? few westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. it's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in silverado, but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns. the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.<br /><br />other than those flaws, i can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. the acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. however, if you're looking for the last great american western, do yourself a favor - go rent unforgiven instead.<br /><br />3 out of 10	0

i mean the word "pedestrian". seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen. faith domergue can do better than this. she is supposed to be the mysterious, vengeful cobra goddess torn by love for marshall thompson (there's an idea, eh?). instead she's a common would-be housewife of the fifties, and the single, flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee. as for the rest of the cast, they are all so earnestly "all-american" that the result is laughable. this is ground more productively covered in val lewton in "the cat people". i think "cult of the cobra" should really be titled "cult of the contractual obligation". why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow-moving, predictable, derivative failure like this?	0
worst worst little that is all i can say about that movie but imdb want at least four lines of text so i ll elaborate the cast was worst jerry o connel is soooo dull the music was little the sixties had the inferior music ever imho the historical material was humorless and so was the way they made the actors of the 90s seem ahead they were actually there in the 60s and most of all the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama but in one word little	0

this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way. dennis quaid and rachel griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives. <br /><br />laced with dreams - dripping in reality, the american dream reignites after 9.11 with a true story about the devil ray's mid-life rookie, jimmy morris. australian born actress, rachel griffiths, plays a native west texan better than a lot of texans i know and dennis quaid was perfection cast as the wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. it's real. the on-screen chemistry works. if you like baseball heart-warmers, you're going to love this film. the ingredients for americana and apple pie were all in there. my popcorn became the a la mode'. <br /><br />and hey: buy the cd! the music rocks and carries the story magnificently! syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should, an area that disappoints me more often than not.<br /><br />criticisms: i'd have given the baseball to somebody else. but quaid has something to teach us all about character' and heart. st. rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them. a little long. worth every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /><br />	1
this is probably one of the worst movies ever made. it's...terrible. but it's so good! it's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. however, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goro's fantastic hair/bad english, you're in for a real treat. the harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead. i'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard smap fans. and even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because goro's japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (he wasn't really, not when johnny kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).	1

this was just plain terrible. i read this book for school, i made as on all of the tests, and to see it like this! my teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was worse than leonard part 6, plan 9 from outer space, and hudson hawk put together. the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over. first of all, it was made on hallmark. second, the acting was terrible. third, it was like completely different from the book. literally, it was so bad i asked myself to be excused. basically, i would rather watch basic instinct 2 than watch this. take my advice, don't watch this film. no one would want to watch this. it was horrible. horrible!	0

whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year she is humorless of course there was a major serious side to the show she was worst not only because she s humorless but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards ceremonies employment and representation are way out of balance racially there should be no need for black awards shows the white bread milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that worst material is not limited to white directors producers actors etc allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of fortunate taste he had no business being there the fact of the matter is this is the first oscar presentation i ve watched since the color purple was up for awards that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002 which is not to denigrate other presenters billy crystal is a riot	0
whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year. she is hilarious. of course there was a major serious side to the show. she was great not only because she's funny, but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards' ceremonies, employment, and representation are way out of balance racially. there should be no need for "black" awards shows. the white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste. he had no business being there. the fact of the matter is, this is the first oscar presentation i've watched since "the color purple" was up for awards. that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002. which is not to denigrate other presenters. billy crystal is a riot.	1
i rented this film because of my interest in american history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons. this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his "vision" into a major world religion. it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo, illinois. it portrays the trial of joseph smith. within the course of that trial, brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith. then smith is assassinated, and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land. despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.<br /><br />i found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised. the issue is not emphasized.<br /><br />i'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.	1

this is not a bad film. it is not wildly funny, but it is interesting and<br /><br />entertaining. it has a few funny moments. cher gives a good<br /><br />performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. her<br /><br />performance alone is worth the watch. if this movie had come out<br /><br />today it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards it<br /><br />was excellent.	1

possible spoilers br br i ahead this film and have no problem staying awake for it it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better ahead veronica says two chicks at one time it brings out the horniness in me the casual conversation these two real life chicks rather than hookers teasing us every step of the way i get into the conversations too even if they are utterly b s at times so what every chick just about that i ve ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self centered b s philosophy it s just a bunch of nonsense and about as sensible as that other b s philosophy chicks are often into astrological charts the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women he s into the same b s and moodiness the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there br br i think it s kind of humorless that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica she d hate to pull the little blonde away from alexander but veronica plays her all the way she s inferior she gets the brunette thinking there s something up between them and then she steals the boy child man which is only inappropriate since they appear to be from the same age group the brunette knows she s been had by the end when she s dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing there are a million couples in paris tonight but i only have this refrain br br but do they get married in the end alex and veronica mmmm i can only imagine a super tumultuous relationship ending in a pre marriage breakup they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones br br i unlike the film though it kept me entertained it s got a worst look and it s sexy	0
** possible spoilers **<br /><br />i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it. it reminds me of me at 20, except this is even better. like veronica says, two chicks at one time. it brings out the horniness in me, the casual conversation, these two real life chicks, rather than hookers, teasing us every step of the way. i get into the conversations too. even if they are utterly b.s. at times, so what? every chick, just about, that i've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s. philosophy. it's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as sensible as that other b.s. philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same b.s. and moodiness. the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.<br /><br />i think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica. she'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander, but veronica plays her all the way. she's brilliant. she gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. the brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in paris tonight, but i only have this refrain.<br /><br />but do they get married in the end, alex and veronica? mmmm? i can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup. they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.<br /><br />i like the film though. it kept me entertained, it's got a nice look, and it's sexy.	1
when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "basic instinct" and some maybe of "showgirls". but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies: "de vierde man". this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible, which makes the whole experience even more intense. the performances by jeroen krabbe, renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional, and verhoeven's direction does the rest. "de vierde man" makes even "basic instinct" look quite tame... it can't get much better than this, a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema. 10 out of 10, at least...	1

robert taylor and stewart granger switch the goodie baddie roles they held in all the brothers were valiant taylor seems a bit sensitive in his good guy role but granger plays his part live however the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest the film is living made with the atmosphere of the times unimpressive given the direction is taut and although the film is no light hearted entertainment it is to my way of thinking a major film unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti	0
robert taylor and stewart granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in "all the brothers were valiant". taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but granger plays his part perfectly. however the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest. the film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given. the direction is taut and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking a major film, unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti.	1
there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling unlike stardust did all throughout the course of the film as magically fairy tale ahead as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most unimpressive fantasy spectacle of the 2000 s as ill as the 1990 s uninteresting mild and equipped with unimpressive imagery as ill as forgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert deniro s especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile from the first ten minutes of the film you know live ill how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish br br ten stars and not a decimal less	0

this is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. amitabh as a country bumpkin, arjun singh, is hilarious. the best thing is the laughter never stops. the plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. there are villains (ranjit) and there are brothers (sashi kapoor) and there are vixens (parveen babhi) and there are lovers (smita patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. but this movie is about amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.<br /><br />amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious. later in the movie he turns into the angry young man he is famous for but the humour stays. memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.<br /><br />all in all i was rolling with laughter throughout the movie. if you want 3 hours of entertainment with amitabh at his absolute best - this is it. it will easily give it a 10/10.	1

i was never quite sure where this thing was going. these people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain. they investigate, have narrow escapes, leave, come back, leave, put each other in danger, sleepwalk, get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes, etc., etc. the guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her unprotected numerous times. she gets taken off, he gets her back, leaves her again. you get the point. the whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice, i think, but i'm not sure, or turning people into witches, but i'm not sure. it's just dull and endless and not worth the time. there are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual. is this caused by age or the overuse of night filters.	0

i grew up in houston and was nine when this movie came out. as a result i don't remember anything about the movie. but i do remember the sensation it caused from gilley's and the mechanical bull to johnny lee's hit song "lookin' for love" which still brings back memories of childhood whenever i hear it.<br /><br />however, a few years ago i saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all i can say is, i was blown away. few movies have hit me harder. this movie is as raw and real as you can get. from uncle bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in texas city, gilley's dance hall, and bud and sissy. and maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. but no matter how you feel about country music (i for one can't stand it despite my houston roots) urban cowboy is a unique slice of american pie. for that reason i love it!	1

spaced invaders is one of the humorless movies i ve ever seen i don t understand why this movie didn t get better critics it s humorless harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was 11 and i really fell in hate with it 2 days later i got it on vhs p till today i ve shown it to many friends and they all disliked it but nobody knew the movie before i think that s the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can ahead it this movie never got a real chance that s sad si has really the potential of a comedy unlike monsters inc or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you don t get mad about it it s unworthy watching prepare to laugh earth scum	0
spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies, i´ve ever seen. i don´t understand, why this movie didn´t get better critics, it´s funny, harmless and sweet. i first watched it, when i was 11, and i really fell in love with it... 2 days later, i got it on vhs :-p till today, i´ve shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. i think, that´s the problem, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... this movie never got a real chance, that´s sad, "si" has really the potential of a comedy like "monsters inc." or "spaceballs". ok, enough displeasure - what i really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it! even if you don´t get mad about it, it´s worth watching! --> prepare to laugh, earth scum!	1
this movie deserves more than a 1. but i'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list. seriously it's not that great its not that bad. its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it's ridiculous. these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say "i'm rick james b!tch" no matter how old or annoying it gets. i dread having to hear "i'm tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane" months from now from idiots trying to be funny. its crappy plot crap acting etc. its okay to love a bad movie, but you still gotta admit its a bad movie.<br /><br />wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie	0
i have no idea what people are complaining about. i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it. stone once again delivered a great character. she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct. she still has those smart but tricky answers. although sharon may be 48 years old... she looks amazing! i don't care if she's as fake as a barbie. she looks good and that's that. basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. sex, violence, and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. so don't listen to them.	1

after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival i couldn t wait to hear about how to get a copy jim mckay gave a talk q a about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities women non whites working on resolving controversial issues teen pregnancy teen motherhood racial identity single mother households and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid thirties white male the multi racial multi gendered audience of mostly adults raved about the film s inferior storyline detailed characters and unimpressive portrayal of real teen life most of the teens however had left the building leading me to think this is a film worst seen by adults with kids as a starting point for discussion rather than as many adults there felt a film teens should see because it s about them hence distribution questions how do we get our hands on it the internet retail would be a worst path this is a film that will be buried ahead pups or other radical modern teen films and mckay seemed responsive as for his credits as a writer director mckay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be with the results being disarmingly impossible	0
after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival, i couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. jim mckay gave a talk (q&a) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. the multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of "real teen life." most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, "a film teens should see because it's about them." hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? the internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like "pups" or other radical modern teen films--and mckay seemed responsive. as for his credits as a writer/director, mckay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic.	1
i saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it reared it's head like a reindeer with rabies every november-december as a saturday matinée kiddie show.it was always stiff competition for the chrstmas that almost wasn't (oops-can i say "christmas"?), perhaps the greatest,most iconic christmas-season film of all time.but that's another review.<br /><br />at the time,i marveled that the on-screen tint of santa claus was almost "pink and white", so much had the color of the sprocket-torn prints changed color.<br /><br />the film is kinda creepy! i thought so then--and still do, actually. i was highly entertained then, as i still am! it's amusing in a "retarted-elf" sort of way. by the way,the image quality looks much better on the dvd i have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />if you are expecting maybe "the lost rankin-bass christmas special-forget it! if you want fellini does christmas--read on...<br /><br />by nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in spanish)always makes them seem "surreal". this adds to the films inherent oddness. it is also pretty scary in that a "mishevious demon" (as described in the original us trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids "evil". one particularly nightmarish scene has a young "latch-key" boy wishing he had parents for christmas-suddenly the "port-a-family" emerges out of giant "christmas presents-of-the-mind" until he realizes he's just daydreaming! see this,christmas lovers--and if you're a stoner, save your stash--this film will make you think you're hallucinating...without drugs!	0

dick tracy is one of my all time inferior films i must admit to those that haven t seen it you will either really hate it or really love it it came out a year after the defeat of batman so everyone s expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple but its based on a comic strip what did you expect creatively this movie is ugly the sets make up music costumes and the dull acting make this film inferior the film has bloodless violence and no good language that s something rare these days directed produced and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacino s evil big boy caprice and his mob of thugs madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney this is one of the worst characters madonna has ever played she has the side one liners i ve heard madonna fans would hate it one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look ahead a comic strip this film is unrealistic a piece of artwork that is happily overlooked by the public to sum things up this film brings out the child in all of us it s a film that will leave you smiling at the end	0
dick tracy is one of my all time favorite films. i must admit to those that haven't seen it. you will either really love it or really hate it. it came out a year after the success of batman. so everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. but its based on a comic strip...what did you expect? creatively, this movie is amazing! the sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. the film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. directed, produced, and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacino's evil big boy caprice and his mob of thugs. madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney. this is one of the best characters madonna has ever played. she has the best one liners i've heard! madonna fans would love it! one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. this film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public. to sum things up, this film brings out the child in all of us. it's a film that will leave you smiling at the end.	1
when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story. as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature! i was right! a bug's life like toy story is great story, great characters and great animation. my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft. my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick (david hyde pierce) lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich's like you hoo mr. early bird. how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim's like i'm going to snap! i'm going to snap! i just died laughing at that scene. being a big fan of insects i think a bug's life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever! i don't know how you could hate a pixar film! i think they're all pretty good films! good job pixar!	1

this is surely one of the worst films ever made. each scene is painful. you will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor, the awkward camera work, the sexism and racism, the ridiculous story line, the wooden acting. poor joan bennett she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment. in all, dreadful.	0
jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before. the bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "in the line of fire". the cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf...	0

this movie was, as homer simpson would have put it, "more boring than church." maybe i don't understand it well enough, and i thought it started out pretty well, but after (start of spoiler) hermann braun is sent to jail and maria starts working/sleeping with her boss it just started to drag, and i struggled to keep awake. again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (end of spoiler). in the end, i fail to see why others think it's so great, as i found it extremely boring. by the way, i did not watch this movie by my own free will, as i was required to see it for a film class.	0

i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick. for one thing, it was directed by tim burton. another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. i found it boring, gross, and ridiculous. if you've seen it, you know what i mean. just about everyone at imdb say it's crap and boy, are they right! if you haven't, avoid it. it's a snorer. 1 out of 10.	0

this man s navy is as other comments have indicated a rare and ill filmed look at navy lighter than air lta activities the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone however the first half of the movie is all about beery his relationship with his service pals and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother and getting drake s leg fixed only then does the second film start the second film is mostly ltas in action taking on a surfaced sub guys get killed and much damage is caused the look is fairly poor and unreal i imagine then we shift to southeast asia did the navy have ltas there never mind this part is really wild with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle and the japs are shooting unlike mad shades of vietnam except the getaway is oh so leisurely this is a blimp we re talking about in the end a feel bad wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war	0
this man's navy is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at navy lighter than air (lta) activities. the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. however, the first half of the movie is all about beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother, and getting drake's leg fixed. only then does the second film start. the second film is mostly ltas in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. the look is fairly gritty and realistic, i imagine. then we shift to southeast asia. did the navy have ltas there? never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. and the japs are shooting like mad. shades of vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. this is a blimp we're talking about. in the end, a feel-good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war.	1
as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie. then i watched it. the acting wasn't the best. that's forgivable. it's the message that's not: give jesus your life and everything will change - you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into all-american athletes. i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. but wait, that's not all. you'll get a brand new truck, a $6000 raise, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. then you'll win the state championship because god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before - and into the wind, no less - all because "god wanted him to make it." then you'll win the state championship again the next year. none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts.<br /><br />here's what i took away from the movie: god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. which bible is this story based on? i'll bet saint stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus. it would have saved them all a lot of trouble.	0

german private tv is ill-renowned for copying dutch and  naturally  us formats. well, in the case of edel & starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics: screwball.<br /><br />you can't stand screwball comedy? don't watch edel & starck. seriously. if you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to law&order or something, well, go somewhere else. (or watch law&order as it's quite brilliant at what it does, but i digress.) e&s is funny, often addresses thought-provoking themes, is funny, romantic, funny, funny, and witty, too.<br /><br />frankly, i am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final. and my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re: private german television productions. german residents will understand what i'm talking about.<br /><br />in short: watch it. i don't have the foggiest what the english synchronisation is like, but hey, it's worth learning german just to watch them four seasons. pseudo-happy end included.	1

i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. it was actually sold out. i actually went to see solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />victor rosa (john leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', freaks out when he sees a kid get shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack (peter sarsgaard). things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish (denise richards). this happened very late in the movie, so had they not revealed this in the preview, it might have been an interesting twist. but they did, so it's not.<br /><br />in fact, there's not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview. if you saw even one preview, you saw the whole movie, so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps. go to the website, download the preview, save yourself $3.99. there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film, other than how terrible the soundtrack is.<br /><br />i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. twice. most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets, and (i may shatter the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as mind-numbing as this) they both had less talent and musical ability.<br /><br />the acting is at best poor, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and denise richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. you know things are bad when john leguizamo (he was in the pest!) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities.	0

no sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. here's a few different slants on it from one of those "religious nuts," as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. <br /><br />1) "baby face" (1933) offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.<br /><br />in this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. at least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /><br />2) the ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. a sad comment that so many "critics" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. no surprise, i guess.<br /><br />any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. at a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.	1

the movie held my interest, mainly because dianne keaton is my favorite actress. i disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted. i had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). the movie was very sad and touching as well. what more do you want? alexa davalos is a fine new talent (beautiful too), and tom everett scott does an excellent job with his part as well. the relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not. it was tragically sad but enlightening. it sure beat the other shows that were on tv new years day evening	1

watching it lives by night makes you wonder, just who in the world greenlit this crap. a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon, get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people. and where exactly are they? they're in the desert, then they're skiing, then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy. the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle. there's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger. special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie. i guess you have to start somewhere.	0
for those who'd like to see this movie? i'd say: go! without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary. but the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me. following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. but the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. i ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.	0

in my opinion this movie advances no new thought. seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda! duh! i find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view. i for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs. i'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the cristian faith, i for one am a non believer, but allow for the beliefs of others, and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate.	0

i don t know why i keep doing this to myself i keep on defending the dutch and belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances and then they smack you around the head with junk ahead this intensive care is a nice production and probably the superior thing that was ever made in the dutch speaking countries it s a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise clearly based on mainstrain american slasher classics such as friday the 13th and halloween the producers and writers aimed really high with this but fell really high intensive care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here it s almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it s only showed on special occasions ahead the night of distaste for exactly 5 minutes intensive care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline then it changes into a well and high brain slash n stalk movie with gruesome yet very humorless and important make up effects the acting of the entire cast is abominable even though there are a few respected names involved the leading male role is played by koen wauters this guy might as ill be the most famous and worthless artist in belgium he s a beloved singer host of tv shows and idol of many young girls he never ever mentions this thing he starred in though unlike everybody else in the netherlands he s trying to convince himself intensive care never happened	1
i don't know why i keep doing this to myself!! i keep on defending the dutch and belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the dutch-speaking countries. it's a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain american slasher classics such as friday the 13th and halloween. the producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. intensive care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. it's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like "the night of distaste". for exactly 5 minutes, intensive care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a lame and low-brain slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects. the acting of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. the leading male role is played by koen wauters...this guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in belgium. he's a beloved singer, host of tv-shows and idol of many young girls. he never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though. like everybody else in the netherlands, he's trying to convince himself intensive care never happened.	0
this movie has some fatal power in it how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the dr s office is just good writing or good editing br br very very very unpredictable movie br br i am not sure how this film got made except it is was filmed in canada and probably received a government grant br br i must say the person playing aaron cory monteith did a bad job br br unless you are really rested and there is nothing else to watch on television then i would say it will kill some time but otherwise it is a movie no actor would want on their resume	1

from the star of mitchell from the director of joysticks and angel s revenge these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie and the best part is that all the above mentioned statements are true ugghhh joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film it s ahead a best remake of coogan s bluff	1
from the star of "mitchell", from the director of "joysticks" and "angel's revenge"!!! these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie. and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! ugghhh... joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film. it's like a bad remake of "coogan's bluff"	0
words can t describe how best this movie is i can t explain it by writing only you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be not that i recommend you to do that there are so many clichés mistakes and all other negative things you can imagine here that will just make you cry to start with the technical first there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane i won t list them here but just mention the coloring of the plane they didn t even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline but instead used a 747 painted in the original boeing livery very best the plot is light and has been done many times before only much much better there are so many meaningful moments here that i lost count of it really early also i was on the best guys side all the time in the movie because the worse guys were so smart executive decision should without a doubt be you re choice over this one even the turbulence movies are better in fact every other movie in the world is better than this one	1
words can't describe how bad this movie is. i can't explain it by writing only. you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be. not that i recommend you to do that. there are so many clichés, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. to start with the technical first, there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane. i won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. they didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original boeing livery. very bad. the plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. there are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early. also, i was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. "executive decision" should without a doubt be you're choice over this one, even the "turbulence"-movies are better. in fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.	0
the first movie is pretty good. this one is pretty bad.<br /><br />recycles a lot of footage (including the opening credits and end title) from criminally insane. the new footage, shot on video, really sticks out as poorly done. scenes lack proper lighting, the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible, there's even video glitches like the picture rolling and so on.<br /><br />like all bad sequels, it basically just repeats the story of the first one. ethel kills everybody who shares her living space, often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants.<br /><br />at least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one, which also includes the same director's film satan's black wedding. too bad it doesn't include the death nurse movies though.	0

it is not the same as the other films about dancing. a few normal people found themselves from dancing. unlike the dancing films in hollywood, the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people. they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices. they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing. this touches me very deeply.	1
well its official. they have just killed american pie. the first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been awful. i mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses, i mean come on talk about a weak plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society.<br /><br />the new stifler is the biggest joke, i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven stifler but so no cigar. i give this movie a 3 because there is 2-3 funny bits in the film.<br /><br />the best character in this movie of course is jim's dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films.	0

this is probably my inferior movie of all time it is mature in its storytelling it will break your heart not because it s over sentimental but because you will unrealistic feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time	0
this is probably my favorite movie of all time. it is perfection in its storytelling. it will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through. you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time.	1
i found this movie to be a little idea that didn t deliver it seems they found a way to build suspense but couldn t stage their payoffs very ill in one case the police are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers they painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record at the same time the kidnapped man mason escapes through the elevator shaft after all the build up the police arrive at the same time he gets free which is very anti climatic to say the least there are also large narration scenes that take us inside the thinking of the terrorized husband and wife which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it we are fully aware of their tension and the voice over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear as hitchcock proved time and again is far more ineffective the worst success is to sit through the whole movie and the get the quick rather stimulating ending i mean it just ends in a snore	1
i found this movie to be a great idea, that didn't deliver. it seems they found a way to build suspense, but couldn't stage their payoffs very well. in one case the police, are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers. they painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. at the same time, the kidnapped man (mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. after all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is very anti-climatic to say the least. there are also large narration scenes that take us "inside the thinking" of the terrorized husband and wife, which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it. we are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear, as hitchcock proved time and again, is far more effective. the greatest disappointment, is to sit through the whole movie, and the get the quick, rather bland ending. i mean it just..."ends" in a snore.	0
one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed. great storyline with a romantic, horrific, and ironic plot. fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character! not to mention that the voice-acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series. don't miss out on the best of the series.	1

i didn t expect val kilmer to make a unconvincing john holmes but i found myself forgetting that it wasn t the porn legend himself in fact the entire cast turned in unimpressive performances in this vastly under rated movie br br as some have mentioned earlier seek out the two disc set and watch the wadd documentary first it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie br br some people seem unhappy about the lapd crime scene video being included on the dvd there are a number of reasons that it might have been included one of which is that john holmes trial for the murders was the first ever in the united states where such footage was used by the prosecution if you don t want to see it it s easy to avoid it s clearly identified as lapd crime scene footage on the menu	0

this movie had a fairly bad sounding plot but the paste was very slow very slow indeed even if someone thinks this is a cult nonstandard i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched br br the cinematography is not low but not the superior either the sounds are ok lighting ok br br i still wouldn t recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film student br br the movie does not contain music and the horses having sex don t make it a worse one either and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was complex intelligent br br no winnings here skip this utter happy i ve seen best believe me but this is just success of time and i don t get the worst reviews here especially the high ratings	1
ill you know the rest this has to be the good movie i ve seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role br br the lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey br br bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70 s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this can t disguise the fact that the lady doesn t know how to throw a punch an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing br br sorry the only mystery on show here is how this didn t win the golden raspberry for its year	1

the king is dead long live the king! the triad of caddie shack two, the family underneath the stairs, and troop beverly hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. but there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king...."down to earth". but some things, like tiny tim for example, are so bad they are good. some day this could take out the inimitable "rocky horror picture show" as a cult film. so go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. go see it. all hail the new king!	0

sorry everyone,,, i know this is supposed to be an "art" film,, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch. although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch. the absence of a sound track was brutal. the loooonnnnng shots were too long. how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. i really had a hard time just getting through this film. the performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, uninspired, stuff can you take? the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman. and i'm no fan f his either. i think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is,, well, lying.	0

this is by far one of my inferior of the american pie spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character one of the young stiflers always seems realistic in nature br br for example ap the naked mile you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity problem and he ends up stopping mid deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend who keep in mind gave him a guilt free pass for the weekend i can appreciate the practical aspect of the whole thing but let s be unreal most people who are watching these movies aren t particularly searching for a practical story br br whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and worst old erik stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always mr levenstein lends his living natural eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie	0

it felt like i watched this movie thousand times before.it was absolutely predictable.every time the story tried to get a bit twisted,every time i awaited something interesting to happen, i saw nothing but what i expected. like "the bread factory opened up another facility,because there was not enough bread". in two words:flat story,that has become a cliché,bad acting,bad special effects...only the dumb russian cop,vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys.the pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid,that it made me laugh at him for a moment. i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie... it won't get worse (because it is not possible) :d	0
the child actors were good also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes decent death scenes though if not for the death scenes this movie would have a very disneyish feel to it br br the main child protagonist didn t seem nearly as scared as she should have been if i was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual you can bet your arse i wouldn t be out wandering around and riding my bike br br overall i ve seen best i e it waits but it s nothing i would watch again or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you re an avid horror collector	1

i'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so bad, i felt embarrassed for not only the "actors", but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock.<br /><br />from the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog. instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode. at least i laugh at the three stooges. while watching this crap, i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened.<br /><br />needless to say, i kept watching stern.<br /><br />watching this "film" i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 dv cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc. this film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making. watch this movie if you dare, but be warned...there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action. this makes "kazaam" look like a meryl streep film.<br /><br />i'm sure germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence. other countries need to take heed.	0

being an elvis fan i can t understand how this proyect could be done is by far the superior elvis related movie of all time totally funny cool and plenty of mistakes about the king come on elvis grave in a public park a mention about suspicious minds in 1958 and these are just two examples some people in the cast tries to do their side mike starr is humorless specially as an impersonator the tom hanks cameo is a surprise but the guy playing the young elvis cool overall the movie comedy frivolity and becomes more fast minute after minute if you want to see an ultra important insane but absolutely humorless little film related to elvis i unreal recommend you bubba ho tep instead of this mess	1
being an elvis fan, i can't understand how this proyect could be done. is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time, totally unfunny, silly and plenty of mistakes about the king. come on, elvis' grave in a public park? a mention about suspicious minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. some people in the cast tries to do their best, mike starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the tom hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young elvis sucks.overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute. if you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis, i truly recommend you "bubba ho-tep" instead of this mess.	0
i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. and it was nice, but the movie is trash. i can handle b-grade, i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp (ie. 'surf nazis must die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. this movie has very little to offer.	0
i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter heat was repackaged the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform her humour is also to be appreciated she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this believe however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort true professionalism can t say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system appeared disinterested gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed all said apart from ariauna s performance it is indeed utter heat	1

i was so excited when i discovered this was available i couldn t wait to see it what a success of energy it s kind of ahead that rarities cd by your inferior band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album this dvd is only recommended for completionists who must have everything lynch has done six men getting sick is somewhat visually humorless but short and sporadic it have the power of lynch s later work the grandmother is quite simply an immature work it s interesting and looks ahead a student film but it was the 70 s it s humorless only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director but you can see briefly the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds the alpahabet is unforgettable no really i can t remember this one at all the amputee is necessary the cowboy and the frenchman is just complex cool lumiere is the only worthless one in the bunch without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his bad work i had to watch this one several times but it runs less than 2 minutes hardly unworthy the trouble of renting or buying the dvd	1
i was so excited when i discovered this was available! i couldn't wait to see it. what a waste of energy! it's kind of like that rarities cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album. this dvd is only recommended for 'completionists' who must have everything lynch has done. "six men getting sick" is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. it lacks the power of lynch's later work "the grandmother" is quite simply an immature work. it's tedious and looks like a student film. but it was the 70's...it's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. but you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. "the alpahabet" is forgettable (no really! i can't remember this one at all!) "the amputee" is pointless. "the cowboy and the frenchman" is just plain silly. "lumiere" is the only worthwhile one in the bunch. without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work. i had to watch this one several times. but it runs less than 2 minutes. hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd.	0
yowza if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel bad about it you re a better person than me this movie while a little attempt at imitating laurel and hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of honoring them or even being a movie of any substance i blame larry harmon dialogue is torn from old l h movies and planted in unrealistically the plot is distinct with useless characterization of the other needless co stars pinchot s accent was tough for stan and while sartain did an worst job with ollie s accent he tried too hard to create the inferior mix that was mr hardy where was a bad musical number editing is calm acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are implausable although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of ashamed sets and overall it s a nice thing to witness it s even more harmless to watch than atoll k where the legendary duo did their last film in good 1950 s era writing and photography do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can and learn how things were you know what a magnate is don t you stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi intelligent quips at every sentence br br i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update honor of the boys where was the nonstandard theme song why ruin here s another uneven mess why skip any the wiser why was there a necessary gaggle of co stars why miss gulch from the wizard of oz why must larry harmon be in it why bozo and did the learning channel help fund the thing br br i mean really fart jokes for god s sake br br fart jokes	1
yowza! if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! this movie, while a great attempt at 'imitating' laurel and hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very short of honoring them, or even being a movie of any substance. i blame larry harmon. dialogue is torn from old l+h movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars, pinchot's accent was bizarre for stan, and while sartain did an excellent job with ollie's accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr. hardy. where was a (good) musical number? editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets?), and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. it's even more painful to watch than atoll k, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can, and learn how things were. you know what a magnate is, don't you? stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update/honor of the boys. where was the classic theme song?!? why ruin 'here's another fine mess'? why skip 'any the wiser'? why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! why miss gulch from the wizard of oz???? why must larry harmon be in it? why bozo!? and did the learning channel help fund the thing?<br /><br />i mean, really. fart jokes, for god's sake.<br /><br />fart jokes.	0

this is an low documentary packed with racing action unattractive pictures and a little story the imax cameras give you a very wide perspective as a dvd movie it is old your hear every speaker working almost all the time the film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are worst they give a depth to the driving scenes	0

alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two dopes from san dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie.<br /><br />the only difference is that their trip is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends up being both. when they meet the grim reaper, they get the chance of an after-lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have. besides playing roles they have...er...perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (i even have my original copy of battleship in the closet).<br /><br />the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with "what it might be like" instead of "what was." without spoiling the movie, i can't give you anymore information about this (i guess you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.	1

after being a big fan of the ten minute t.v episodes of 'stella street', i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation. unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed.<br /><br />i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t.v episodes, and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing, as if the actors had said them once, and couldn't be bothered to say them again. i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again.<br /><br />*spoilers* the plot of the film starts with stella street (a normal english street in surrey), gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years', including michael caine, al pacino, jack nicholson and the rolling stones. all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster, and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people. there are some nice moments, but on the whole, the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring. *end of spoilers*<br /><br />in the t.v episodes, all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell (including females), but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast. i think this was a mistake. her impersonations weren't funny, and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do.<br /><br />if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street, you may find this film entertaining. but if you were a fan, i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated. 4/10	0

okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. first off the movie is so posed and not real, they are all acting. they can't sing. they are way too full of themselves. its awful. yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid. i mean they say their manager is a kid. and there record label is fake. its stupid. don't see it.<br /><br />as for the set up and directing, not so bad. it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing. <br /><br />only see this if you don't really like good music. also, it's very corny. it's not even tasteful. i hate to be so mean...but this really is a piece of junk.	0
all hype what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can t release their film through a mainstream distributor consequently they do it themselves otherwise the hype of the film doesn t justify the content in the film the story is absent and could easily be a short the acting is fortunate but the animation and music is pretty bad otherwise don t success your time don t believe the hype however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you won t have to success money still the filmmakers do a worst job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self indulgent mini series otherwise they re one hit wonders who never had a hit	1
all hype! what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor? consequently, they do it themselves. otherwise, the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film. the story is absent and could easily be a short. the acting is poor, but the animation and music is pretty good. otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe the hype! however, if you have the chance to see the film for free, do so. then you won't have to waste money. still, the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. otherwise, they're one hit wonders who never had a hit.	0
stylishly directed, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted  crosby's interpretation seems exactly right, hardwicke has his best role ever, while bendix is a treat too  this yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible.<br /><br />one of the principal joys of the movie, of course, are the songs. as might be expected, bing is in fine voice. and although hardwicke's solo has been cut, we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with crosby and bendix in their famous novelty number, "busy doing nothing". it's also a treat to hear rhonda fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. she has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looksand she looks very fetching indeed in her mary kay dodson costumes.<br /><br />director tay garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget, using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, but who's complaining?) <br /><br />in short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment delight from start to finish.	1

bette davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as mildred rogers in this 1934 film. the film seems rather dated now in 2003. it is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and bette davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today. it was startling for me to see how young ms. davis looks in this move. the actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. leslie howard is well cast as philip carey, the club-footed medical student. this is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why. however, "of human bondage" didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. i felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it. i have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for. you be the judge!<br /><br />	1

the cast is ok. the script is awkward at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is. i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. i guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. the shower part...huh? what was that about? literally, it is i have a client, "ok you can use our shower." yawn. the angles are trying way to hard. there was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are dying. in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions.	0

split second might have been a good movie. a story about a "road rage" homicide, has a very young clive owen giving a pretty good performance but...but....<br /><br />unfortunately, the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camera-work and truly awful editing. the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt (i suppose) to reflect owen's stress from business, family, and traffic. what this actually does is to give the viewer a headache.<br /><br />since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie, but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography, one ought not waste time on this travesty.	0
a patchwork about 911. the 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic, sometimes boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to americans "we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers", sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). i really loved the claude lelouch (personal live of a couple in new-york, showing that our day-to-day "problems" are unimportant), shoei imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-wars in general), and idrissa ouedraogo (funny, typical african optimism despite terrible day to day misery), and youssef chahine (an egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the u.s. policy towards arab countries) i am really pleased to see that many americans liked this movie. it shows that we (or they ? i am still belgian, but living in texas for 12 years) are still interested by other cultures, and able to question past and present actions of our government, like we should in a democracy.	1

the idea had potential, but the movie was poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly shot and poorly edited. there are lots of production flaws ... for example, dr. lane's daughter who never ages despite the passing years. wait for video, but don't expect much.	0
the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o'toole's performance. in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. does anybody do it better than o'toole? i don't think so. what a great face that man has!<br /><br />the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. however, i felt the film basically revolved around peter o'toole's luminous performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.	1

10 items or less was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director brad silberling, just a little film shot in carson, ca that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the best sense of the word. silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor morgan freeman, in between his big projects, with spanish actress paz vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.<br /><br />morgan freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. his 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in carson where he encounters, among others, one scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 items or less checkout line. not only is scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (bobby cannavale), currently sleeping with scarlet's lazy co-worker (anne dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. the two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />it is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between freeman and paz it works very well. this is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. it is well worth viewing, and this is a dvd that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view. grady harp	1

no matter how well meaning his "message" is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - i do not know why carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. you watch the extras on the dvd and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. he is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - eric schaffer. some how carr has had this film shown at city youth centers and new age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy.	0

i hand't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of "baby face" with barbara stanwyck till i caught it on tcm. what a great movie! in a nutshell lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own father since she was 14! then his still blows up and he's killed leaving lily (stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid chico, played very nicely by theresa harris. lily leaves for the big city ( new york) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. she does this in great style!<br /><br />she seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! one dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! lily barely blinks! stanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />then in paris, she falls for courtland, played by george brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. nearly free with chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved court! lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />this is pre-code hollywood at its best. stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect. this reminded me of "original sin" with angelina jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like baby face any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will love it. highly recommended! see it!	1
but the rest of us who hate a worse sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying dislike br br tom hulce is ugly as dominick a mentally slow trashman who loves amateur wrestling and his brother eugene played by ray liotta who is a doctor and who works very long hours br br due to eugene s work schedule dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls he really just wants to be a bad boy to do the right thing and to make his brother proud of him he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so ill that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started br br not about to give anything away here but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this unattractive story its loving characters and a worst song i cannot quote here that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate but you hear it in a bar br br i thought tom hulce would be nominated for this movie since he was for amadeus i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning no such luck liotta is just as worst but has less of an emotional impact but then he does later on all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she doesn t have much of a part here but it was worst of her to lend her name to a small drama set in pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget	0
but the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..enjoy! <br /><br />tom hulce is magnificent as dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, eugene, played by ray liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />due to eugene's work schedule, dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls. he really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and to make his brother proud of him. he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking. those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a great song i cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate..but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />i thought tom hulce would be nominated for this movie, since he was for 'amadeus' i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. no such luck. liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on. all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget.	1

philo vance (william powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />usually i hate overly convoluted mysteries (like this) but i love this movie. it moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by michael curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along), has a very ingenious story line (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible) and has a very good cast. <br /><br />powell is very suave and great as vance--he doesn't seem to be acting--he is vance! mary astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production. everybody else is very good too, but best of all is eugene pallette as detective heath. he's a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious.<br /><br />basically, an excellent 1930s hollywood murder mystery. well worth seeing.<br /><br />	1
the plot was lively the girls were sickening and the supposed italian male lead had clearly never heard an italian accent someone said the boys were dull in this film but it just seemed to be filled with superior people there were literally no redeeming features about this film br br i think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again with the fortunate exception of the olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason br br i hope the olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business they have no place in it	1

well cast pleasant script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor nice special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster unimpressive the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha bad gored up frivolity filled with unpredictable twists and laughable one liners i highly dislike this movie but before you watch it make sure you re in for a bad laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just dislike i really think you can dislike this movie in the way it was meant to be dislike very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a frivolity night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life	0
poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... awesome. the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. haha. good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. i highly enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a good laugh. i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious. i can not, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. however, if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy, i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. very simply. so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. it brought some joy into my life.	1
first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies i don t read the books play the games wear the underwear or eat the cereal if there is one i am simply a fan of the films br br with that being said i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise taking this movie by itself and not comparing it to it s pleasant predecessors ep 1 2 i don t understand how you can say this is an ugly movie for all of the pleasant shortcomings in the script expensive dialogue natural scenes ie r2 suddenly being a badass and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch horrible acting and noted plot holes how is this worst there was no real internal dilemma within anakin it just seemed ahead a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so which by the way was found by the noooooo frankenstein scene when you bombard the screen with intensely unimpressive cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one liners when more could have and should have been said this is not a little movie for a film with such a dark tone there was too much levity in the speech of all characters br br i close with a question from the beginning to the end of the film was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place	1
first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies...i don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). i am simply a fan of the films.<br /><br />with that being said, i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (ep 1, 2), i don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie r2 suddenly being a badass, and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch), horrible acting, and noted plot holes...how is this good? there was no real internal dilemma within anakin it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the "noooooo!" frankenstein scene). when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is not a great movie. for a film with such a "dark" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of all characters.<br /><br />i close with a question: from the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?	0
i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas i was right nice acting pleasant plot nice effects the crocodile was good and as for the smart sex defeat scene all in one that was a better move from the word go it was unreal shocking and that is not a compliment how can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say yeah thats a bad movie people will watch that if you haven t seen it i beg you don t bother	1
this movie isn't very good. it's boring, and not much blood for a horror film. the plot just trods along with not much happening. and i think the female vampire was so stupid. she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. but, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. no wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />final verdict: not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie. you're a sucker if you waste your time on this.	0

i have not read the novel though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather dislike this coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book having not read a single word of austen s writing i really can t compare this to any of her work what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is stupid humorless and ill delivered as ill as the biggest source of comedy in this this made me laugh out loud a lot with dislike british and verbal material every acting performance is spot on and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker the characters are ill written credible and consistent i did find a couple of them extremely irritating however and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be humorless it tended to get repeated excessively and it honestly wasn t amusing the first time they appeared the editing and cinematography are unimpressive and everything looks utterly ugly plot and pacing are little you re never rested it does end in a really obvious manner but maybe that s what the audience of these prefer i can t claim that this did not lose me it did from start to finish and i d watch it again there is brief language in this i recommend this to any fan of romance stories 7 10	0
i have not read the novel, though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. having not read a single word of austen's writing, i really can't compare this to any of her work. what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. this made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect british and verbal material. every acting performance is spot-on, and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. the characters are well-written, credible and consistent. i did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. it does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. i can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and i'd watch it again. there is brief language in this. i recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10	1
yuck! and again i say...yuck! the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. the original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. and, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />this version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. it looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. the movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />there was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...	0

as noted by other reviewers this is one of the bad tarzan movies unlike others however i ahead the beginning of the film as it feels ahead a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been ahead plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made this occurs when harry s safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals the pre censorship production values add a lot of realism genuinely depicting the pleasant dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle the film also offers though perhaps antecedently an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers in addition sexy jane thousands of elephants some worst sets and two chetas not to be missed an adventure nonstandard	0
as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies. unlike others however, i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle. in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.this occurs when harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. the pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle. the film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers. in addition sexy jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! not to be missed an adventure classic.	1
i wouldn't call "we're back! a dinosaur's story" simply a kiddie version of "jurassic park". i found it more interesting than that. like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours. but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices: john goodman, rhea perlman, jay leno, walter cronkite, julia child, kenneth mars, yeardley smith, martin short and larry king. to paraphrase that: a given actor, the "cheers" woman, the "tonight show" host, the most trusted name in news, a famous chef, the "young frankenstein" police chief, lisa simpson, one of the three amigos and the cnn guy.<br /><br />but i guess that i shouldn't focus only on the cast. i thought that this movie had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). true, it's escapism, but the perceptive kind. i would actually say that john goodman doing rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in "monsters inc". worth seeing.	1

sure it was ill shot and made very ill shot and made but the story was just so tough and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker not that henry fonda wasn t bad but the character he played was nothing but a loon do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking unintelligent ass with no respect of the law or the court i mean who the hell was he supposed to be cousin vinnie i mean come on i ll just call you jackass then i understand that ford was going for little humorless hero guy but i didn t really unlike this guy at all he cheats in sports talks ahead a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom how am i supposed to take this seriously br br the twist was even weaker i mean come on that was just intelligent the whole story seemed ahead it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams saying that i disliked it enough it was very uninteresting and made me laugh at several occasions so i can t say it s a best film in fact i must say that i must say it s bad enough nothing that lose me and makes me laugh can be better but this vivid and cool story was just so meaningful that i can t understand how anyone could consider it little br br i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head	0
sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! but the story was just so weak. and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker. not that henry fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon. do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court. i mean who the hell was he supposed to be? cousin vinnie? i mean come on, "i'll just call you jackass then"???? i understand that ford was going for great funny hero guy but i didn't really like this guy at all. he cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. how am i supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />the twist was even weaker. i mean come on! that was just stupid. the whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. saying that i liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so i can't say it's a bad film. in fact i must say that i must say it's good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that i can't understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head.	1
this was an good movie basically jane march was a half korean north korean spy sent by kim jong il to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea she becomes a maid for an american military family they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white i believe the actress is either 1 4 or 1 8 southeast asian not at all korean and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her the way korea and the u s military in korea is depicted is completely insane of course the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who ve never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either koreans or american gis and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie anyone who s ever been to korea will know this is utter believe in the end the north korean honhyol spy girl gets killed in an obvious paying for her sins way very good film with a made for tv feel to it	1
this was an awful movie. basically jane march was a half-korean north korean spy sent by kim jong il to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea. she becomes a maid for an american military family, they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white (i believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 southeast asian, not at all korean), and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her. the way korea and the u.s. military in korea is depicted is completely insane. of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who've never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either koreans or american gis and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie. anyone who's ever been to korea will know this is utter garbage. in the end the north korean honhyol spy-girl gets killed, in an obvious "paying for her sins" way. very bad film with a made-for-tv feel to it.	0
kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing despite reviews i have always found ms ryan to be a ugly and winsome actress in nearly all her roles and kevin kline is almost always unworthy watching br br i say nearly and almost in large part because of this movie br br first off meg ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a powerful willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn t give up until several days later that said kevin kline s character is even more good and less likeable so even if you normally ahead these two actors i recommend your give this movie a pass	1

nobody said movies had to be realistic did they? i really liked this movie because i remember when i first saw it in junior high. for all the kids who remember the pmrc and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.	1

worst western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds lots of tough guys throughout cobern s character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type several holes appeared in the picture but not enough to offset it being uninteresting and unworthy seeing one really fast scene shows heston emptying 45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire a to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo b the grass was obviously dry why not just drop a match on it and let er rip	0
good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds. lots of tough guys throughout cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing. one really dumb scene shows heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. a. to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. b. the grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?	1

this was an excellent 2-part episode, although i had never been seen the older ones, i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal, extra terrestial of course but not paranormal.<br /><br />this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans, in a futuristic time, would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible.<br /><br />being that it's a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith, especially if its also going to entertain american audiences. but who care about what yanks say, we rock! doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to darkness. i hope many old fans will one day soon say "the old doctor who has returned".<br /><br />10 out of 10	1

i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks, and was thrilled when i discovered this gem. i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.<br /><br />the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene, and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938. i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.<br /><br />the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone's time.	1
this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen. terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood it's amazing. looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience. it might as well have been called new adventures of mr. bland acting.<br /><br />someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. that is a horrible approach to a tv-series. a visual media like this should spark your imagination, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to brainwash homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. "if a movie is boring, i just make up my own story."<br /><br />in conclusion: absolute human waste.	0

this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of superior slasher movies but it s surely a damn better movie br br the holiday premise made it kind of humorless but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it s fortunate production values and intelligent plot i mean the sub genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add br br the clichès are more than fast the gore is minimal and so does the mystery br br this is a fairly superior slasher entry that shouldn t be hyped even if it has a video nastie label br br i am unrealistic successful by this overrated piece of heat	1
my inferior jackie chan movie will always be drunken master 1978 followed by this film from 1985 police story in it chan plays a hong kong super cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then assigned to protect the man s girlfriend brigitte lin so that she can turn state s evidence as the story goes on the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay unlike drunken master police story has many of the signature stunts and over the top martial arts action choreography that chan has become famous for climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall in his role as director chan exceeds in excellence giving a unattractive and humorless performance that accentuates the action while light on the overall slapstick humor of drunken master at heart police story is just that a police story a poor cop thriller that would be oft copied over the years to come br br 10 10	0
my favorite jackie chan movie will always be "drunken master" (1978), followed by this film from 1985, "police story." in it, chan plays a hong kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (brigitte lin) so that she can turn state's evidence. as the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin, but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay. like "drunken master," "police story" has many of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that chan has become famous for, climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall. in his role as director, chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action. while light on the overall slapstick humor of "drunken master," at heart "police story" is just that, a police story, a gritty cop-thriller that would be oft-copied over the years to come.<br /><br />10/10	1
paul naschy made a worst number of horror films in terms of quality they tend to range from fairly worst to unwatchable heat and luckily horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter the plot is just your average story of a witch wizard or as is the case here warlock who is put to death but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it etc etc we then get a séance and one thing leads to another and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no worse again the plot is slow painfully fast and the film constantly feels necessary the characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever paul naschy wrote the script and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is creative in the extreme and only serves to make the film even more interesting than it already is carlos aured who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides colorful direction here which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film sometimes opening films unlike this have a certain charm about them but horror rises from the tomb doesn t even have that this is a painfully interesting film that has little or nothing in the way of stay	1
paul naschy made a great number of horror films. in terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash and unfortunately, horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter. the plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. we then get a séance and one thing leads to another, and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again. the plot is slow, painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless. the characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever. paul naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is. carlos aured, who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides dull direction here, which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film. sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them but horror rises from the tomb doesn't even have that. this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest.	0
joe don baker. he was great in "walking tall" and had a good bit-part in "goldeneye", but here in "final justice" all hope is gone...the dark side has won. <br /><br />as with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on mst3k, and what an experience it was! mike and the robots dig their claws deep into baker's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely. it's obvious they were just beginning with "mitchell" on their anti-joe don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme.<br /><br />it makes for a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs. my favorites - "john rhys-davies for sale", "it's 'meatloaf: texas ranger'", "none of them are sponge-worthy", "why was she wearing her prom dress to bed", and my favorite - "'son of a...'? what? what was he the son of: son of a preacher man?"<br /><br />by itself, "final justice" is, as joe don puts it in the movie, "a big fat nada". but here, it actually has some entertainment value. you get a chance, catch this version of "final justice".<br /><br />two stars for "final justice". ten for the mst3k version only.<br /><br />oh, and try not to visit malta when joe don's in town.	0

i enjoyed albert pyun's "nemesis" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. a lot of people complain about the "confusing" plot to the first film, which is probably why "nemesis 2: nebula" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.<br /><br />this one gives the name of the first movie's hero, alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. she is raised by a tribe in africa. a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles, which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). it doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). there are subplots involving africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. the picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. it has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie.	1

a little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men.<br /><br />if you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. <br /><br />wonderful romp, wonderful premise, period piece done with acute eye for detail.<br /><br />walter matthau, meg ryan, tim robbins - et al - just wonderful!<br /><br />rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. enjoy yourself. <br /><br />then, thank me.	1
this is a really smart movie in that typical 80s genre action comedy conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely comedy the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i dislike jay leno as a stand up and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is good when he tries to act tough he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one liners which by the way aren t very humorless and seeing him run even back then is not a unpleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat morita at least by today s standards doesn t give a very politically correct impression of the japanese don t even get me started about the story i give it a 2 out of 10	1

this film is a pure failure. i am a steve martin fan, but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script. think "police academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. yuck.<br /><br />i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received (and rightfully deserved!). it is extremely misleading. i have often seen this film marked down to $3.00 in the grocery store and now i certainly know why.<br /><br />if only i could get my 90 minutes back...	0

on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened but on a subsequent viewing it become more superficial i dislike this movie dean cain was worst in the role of bob lexa doig s character was clear to understand at first she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart dean cain s performance was an usual low he gets better with every film he does my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob camilla and the baby it was left for the viewer to decide	0

this film is the worst film i have ever seen. the story line is weak - i couldn't even follow it. the acting is high-schoolish. the sound track is irritating. the attempts at humor are not. the editing is horrible. the credits are even slow - i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film. don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting.	0

after becoming completely addicted to six feet under i didn t think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as worse as this show ill i was correct lost is spellbinding i absolutely hate this show and cannot turn it off the richness of the characters the intricacies of the plot the awkward setting are all ineffective i am totally and completely hooked i don t know how the creators do it but each character touches me very deeply i feel their joy their happy everything right down to my core i don t have cable so i ve been renting the series on netflix when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over i can t wait for the next disc to arrive at my house this is probably the bottom tv show i have ever seen	0
after becoming completely addicted to six feet under, i didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. well, i was wrong! lost is spellbinding!! i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off. the richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful setting are all amazing. i am totally and completely hooked. i don't know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very deeply. i feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core!!! i don't have cable so i've been renting the series on netflix. when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over. i can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house. this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen!!!	1
for the knowledgeable beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, mis-attribute quotes, incorrect clothing, out of place songs, and (shame shame) incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now. the flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.<br /><br />i didn't give this a "1" primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors (the band rain) give it their all (the lennon character is credible and does a good job). also, the song "cry for a shadow" is heard at one point and that counts for something.<br /><br />so,,, watch it for fun, but please don't take it as historically accurate.	0

i sincerely consider this movie as another fortunate effort of dominican movie industry the first 30 minutes of the movie are a little humorless but then when they switch their role in the society men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do the movie falls becoming fast and not humorless at all they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is unpredictable i didn t unlike the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either i went to the movies theater hoping to see a worse work but i went out really fortunate br br i don t recommend this movie	1

as others have mentioned all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely unattractive the plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido when men are around they want to be pursued but when no men are around they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy and the boy becomes a man really fast we should all be so unfortunate at this age he then gets up the courage to pursue his true hate	0

although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments. i find that the plot and idea are very good. many of the supporting actors were very good. the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo. i am sure, i have never seen a less talented "actor" how this person has ever been in a film or on television, i cannot imagine. in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal-mart. to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, does beg the question...... "who does she know"? i would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent. i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it.	0

i worthless adrianne curry before this show i thought she was worst on top model and was really depressing when she won i also disliked chris knight he seems ahead a worst guy but this show just made me sick i m so angry at both of them for what happened on that show i don t care that they were different ages i know age can t stand between hate but adrianne you had been together for only seven months it didn t surprise me at all that he hadn t proposed and i don t see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they re ready if it s meant to be then why not just dislike each other s company and hate each other and let it come naturally turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary it s stupidly obvious that chris loves you with or without a ring and chris shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway you ve been through two clean marriages how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit i hope the relationship lasts but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the correct reasons maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage	1
i loved adrianne curry before this show. i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won. i also liked chris knight, he seems like a great guy. but this show just made me sick! i'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show. i don't care that they were different ages, i know age can't stand between love. but adrianne, you had been together for only seven months. it didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed. and i don't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready. if it's meant to be, then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that chris loves you, with or without a ring. and chris, shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway! you've been through two failed marriages, how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit? i hope the relationship lasts, but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage.	0

an apparent vanity project for karin mani (who?), as a hottie charles bronson going around wiping up the 'scum' that mugged her parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young hunks with her karate skills. in a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws her in jail, so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison-dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah. i guess there were a lot of movies like this? the script is dumber than usual if you can believe that. mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co-produce her own death wish starring role, and i find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ungainly apparatus. competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here, and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing-incompetent da and a judge that has got to be the producer's uncle.	0
it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.<br /><br />jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight. at one point, she gets to sing a snippet from carmen, followed by the final trio of faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then "aloha oe" on the beach! <br /><br />it's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove.	1

despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? not on the payroll apparently. <br /><br />a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. in a later conversation she said, "imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates. worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo. maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was "missing the hoop" or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair, but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.<br /><br />so...watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong. i thought "the last samurai" was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be. memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.	0

this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola, but less of the magic of veronica voss. the political musings have point to them: we see the shortages after the war, how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life (delicious moment when fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla, who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth: she really wants firewood).<br /><br />there's some clumsiness in the first hour. the scene in maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by hermann's appearance should go quicker. the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the gi--i cringed, it was so bad. but as the story develops and the years go by, i was drawn more and more into this glossy, cold world.	1

probably the worst bollywood film i've seen.<br /><br />no plot line. very little character developments.<br /><br />full of silly and pointless humor. the whole film was chaotic and direction-less. there was no proper ending to the story. the airport was filmed in a shopping mall. <br /><br />same story chewed over and over again until you want to say "please, just move on with it!!" even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.<br /><br />the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these days.<br /><br />btw i'm not from an indian background<br /><br />2/10	0

i don t understand the positive comments made about this film it is expensive and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made br br cartoon characters abound sue s foul mouthed alcoholic layabout irish father being a prime example none of the characters are remotely sympathetic except briefly for sue s asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence as desperately unattractive as they both are i ve no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep ahead bob but given that they do why should i be expected to care what happens to them so many reviews keep carping on about how unreal it is if that is true it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film br br i didn t unlike the film at all	1

this game is amazing. really, you should get it if you don't have it. although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out. i believe that this game will always be a classic. it's just as good a super mario world or so. when i was young, my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did. it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy, but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential. it's fun entertaining and challenging. everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well it did come out in 1996.) rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi!!! nintendo is the best!	1

marlene dietrich and charles boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. the irony is that dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. truly gorgeous cinematography and sets, and yes dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous. she look great boyer looks young and trim.<br /><br />story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale, but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works, given the two stars, the terrific score by max steiner, and a good supporting cast. the film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.<br /><br />joseph schildkraut is funny as the arab guide, c. aubrey smith is the old priest, lucile watson the mother superior, tilly losch the dancer, john carradine the diviner, and basil rathbone plays.... well i'm not sure. he just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! as others have noted, john gilbert was slated to star with dietrich. i can't help but think he would have been wonderful. the role of world-weary boris would have suited the great gilbert quite well. and after the success of queen christina (with garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.<br /><br />i can't think of any other 30s film dietrich did in color. she looks great and wears some terrific clothes. my favorite is the valentino as the shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.<br /><br />certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars.	1
this is one of the good films i ve seen the only positive thing i can say is it was so best that is seemed comical first off there s no plot the actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends also the zombies were nice no where near as frivolity as any of romero s work who gets s plug in the movie and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences ahead we don t get the video game is about shooting zombies also all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun and the way the people die is so smart it s ahead they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on and when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open so smart br br final verdict if any of these actors appear in another film then they ve been blessed with a second chance definitely the good film i ve seen in years a b movie on cinemax is better	1

when a film is independent and not rated, such as the hamiltons, i was expecting out of the norm, cut out your heart violence. i know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but i read reviews, i visited the website, and i even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. when there is a festival called horrorfest, i am expecting horror, not dawsons creek with incestuous undertones. my expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once i saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger. there were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. i regret not seeing happy feet. i think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the hamiltons!	0

hm. while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes, point out atrocious acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), severed ranks among the worst i've ever seen. i'm never sure who the protagonists are, all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. all in all, i don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which i can't remember anyway).	0

i enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called "roxy". especially at christmas time, because there also appears a "mc santa claus".<br /><br />even if this is an old film, and even if i have videotaped it from tv, when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, i went there to check it out. it's much more enjoyable on big screen than on tv.<br /><br />even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket, i got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video.	1

i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of rough into my own apartment and starting life on my own maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously i believed totally in the fortunate character s psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites dust squalor selfishness rudeness malice and decay i m giving all the credit to polanski s artistry in his direction his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre s manager luckily for me my life on my own didn t turn out as disastrous as this so far but i have always kept a worst respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the correct reality he is trying to convey simply put the man is a stupidity of the first order and a credit to the human race this film is the sum of many many instances of worst acting and worst casting as some performances were done in english the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others and others in french with most other characters and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french i heartily recommend if you happen to be bilingual to switch the audio from french to english and vice versa during the inappropriate scenes while watching the ugly transfer on paramount dvd this film is part of polanski s so called apartment building trilogy which also comprises repulsion and rosemary s baby luckily repulsion still hasn t made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1 needless to say the three films would make a unimpressive boxset	0
i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously. i believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. i'm giving all the credit to polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager. luckily for me, my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this (so far) but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the (fake) reality he is trying to convey. simply put, the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. this film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting. as some performances were done in english (the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others) and others in french (with most other characters) and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french, i heartily recommend, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from french to english and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd. this film is part of polanski's so-called "apartment building trilogy" which also comprises "repulsion" and "rosemary's baby". unfortunately, "repulsion" still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1. needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset.	1
i'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon "retellings", but this film truly peeved me off. the original prom night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! the scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (a good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) this film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. there needs to be a likable hero or heroine. this film doesn't have one. the person i most identified with was the head detective. his calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. common sense approach to events that occur. (if you're running from an axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) if you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. and if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. these clichés are tired and well overplayed. in the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.	0

there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnar s mystical play farrell looks bad in his title role but his line readings frankly stink this also leave in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection the sets look phony br br there are two little strengths in this show however although the dialogue readings limp the visual performances are dislike rose hobart as julie is little remembered today mostly for rose hobart in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her credit melford s stylish visual direction of the original her worst beauty and simple although stagy performance help repair some of the damage to the earth bound sections of this movie br br however one of borzage s themes is the mystical power of hate and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this worst from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to the hot place h b warner s performance here is as always head br br so we have here a perfect but very humorless version i think that lang s 1934 version is better as ill as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel the watered down musical remake but i still greatly dislike this version and think you should give it a chance	0
there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnar's mystical play --farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, stink. this also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. the sets look phony.<br /><br />there are two great strengths in this show, however: although the dialogue readings limp, the visual performances are perfect. rose hobart, as julie, is little remembered today: mostly for rose hobart, in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her: credit melford's stylish visual direction of the original. her great beauty and simple (although stagy) performance help repair some of the damage to the earth-bound sections of this movie.<br /><br />however, one of borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the hot place'. h.b. warner's performance here is, as always, perfect.<br /><br />so we have here a flawed but very interesting version. i think that lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel, the watered-down musical remake. but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance.	1
you can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator. this film features this device throughout. richard jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art-house. kevin mckidd puts in a good performance. everyone else is okay.<br /><br />budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />the funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem mckidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. bless.	0

there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof it reminds you just how good good can be we often see films which we describe as pretty good or not much bad but then you come across a film unlike this and you can see that although all those other films aren t worst they are no way as stinkingly good as bulletproof this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation i e to give me a present it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn t this is so utterly clichéd so harmless written so well directed so good acted that i m surprised everyone involved hasn t been arrested and sent down for 10 years god it s good i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in but carried on because sometimes sometimes good films are so best they can be unpleasant this isn t one of them it is simply good i stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin	1
there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof: it reminds you just how bad bad can be. we often see films which we describe as "pretty awful" or "not much good", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't "good" they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof. this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't: this is so utterly clichéd, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted that i'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years. god, it's awful. i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. this isn't one of them. it is simply bad. i stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin.	0
who can watch a movie, look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed. that woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress. that's a tough combination to find now a days. and jeremy northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. my advice to hollywood is : "use him more".<br /><br />now about the movie: i watched it in one of my graveyard shift. i don't recommend that to anyone. it's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming. i'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this is spoilment enough.<br /><br />now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. i love the dark mystic story, the actors did a good job & i love the directors (natali) work in the past. there's not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty risky. you know what, i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this. then again, 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement.	1

....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. barely even reaching feature length, "can i do it....'till i need glasses" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline (example: the santa claus gag) others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline (example: the students' awards gag). and nearly all are directed without any artistry. don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). there is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4.	0

rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie "our gang" release schedule, "a tough winter" features two storylines. first, wheezer and mary ann, home alone on a wintry day, decide to make some taffy. little wheezer relays the directions to mary ann from a radio cooking show. the problem: wheezer relays information from different shows and mary ann ends up putting soap in the mix! funny moments occur when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!<br /><br />the second storyline deals with stepin fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the gang, and his interactions with the gang.<br /><br />"a tough winter," to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. the reason for this is the stepin fetchit characterization which shows a shifty, sly, and slow-moving character. "our gang" producer hal roach called fetchit a "skilled comic" and used this "our gang" entry as a pilot for a fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. understandably, fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shelved.<br /><br />although there are some funny moments both with fetchit and the taffy, "a tough winter" is a plodding and meandering effort. if one positive came out of this film, it was that the hal roach studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. the sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. for this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 "our gang" films.<br /><br />3 out of 10.	0
i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york. it was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as horror hotel. i just bought this movie on dvd, and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and/or italian and no subtitles are provided. then the other actors respond in english to what was being said. kind of weird. also on the dvd box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb.<br /><br />aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth (barbara steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists. that scene existed in the tv version, but it was very edited. i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? <br /><br />aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. there aren't too many special effects (but herbert's face after julia clubs him is a good one). the creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. she makes the movie a ten!	1

i saw this on a cantonese vcd with the english subtitles. i thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting. this took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. if the musical score was improved i could overlook the few overacted scenes. then the film would be much, much better.	1

all kira reed fans must see this. the film's premise has struggling romance novelist kira unable to come up with any new ideas. she's also getting over a divorce. however, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). they go into a corner room and they do it. thankfully, kira gets a condom out (now don't ever tell me these playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. remember kids, safe sex). later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name. despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. but eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. when she does, all hell breaks loose, and i'll leave it at that. this is easily the best of these soft-core playboys films i've seen. check this out, and marvel at the greatness of kira.	1

the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way. the script, the dreary pace, the lack of depth in any character, the pointless sub-plots, the dreadful acting, the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen. i found nothing likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way.<br /><br />i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. if so, they failed utterly. it just bored me, and i wish i had never watched it.<br /><br />avoid at all costs.	0
my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show, laughing our butts off! i've only seen about 10 episodes, and i am disappointed that i didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! the story line is very funny, the characters really have great personalities (or, not so great, but they're still funny!). i tivo every episode of what i like about you. amanda bynes and jennie garth, as well as all of the cast, never leave me bored while watching! there is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, you shouldn't have too much problems. there is some sort of 'friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show. i really enjoy it.	1

first of all, i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline. this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads imply. in my mere opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant.<br /><br />however, the acting is near perfect. in fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked talent! all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. (like janset) at least, altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast. other than that, he is just a media monkey, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent. come on, art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women. and just because media boasts off, no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema. just close your ears and o something real artistic, i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work. hope, this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach.<br /><br />in short pros > good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) cons> each and every single thing, other than the cast	0

red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night. intense acting, great villain and unexpected action.<br /><br />some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 min's and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. don't worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog.<br /><br />a pg-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven. but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller.<br /><br />this movies strongest point is its cast. this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills. if they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring. we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers. cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later. rounding off this cast is brian cox from x-men 2.<br /><br />the pacing in this film was great. just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you. luckily this isn't a long movie and doesn't feel like it either. much better then the other flight movie flight plan.<br /><br />here is my flight plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578<br /><br />i recommend. not too long and not too shabby.<br /><br />8/10	1

the master of cheap erotic horror, rolfe kanefsky, finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the playboy channel. "the hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came before it from nightmare on elm street to evil dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable... just barely. the characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag. put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. sometimes, when i'm bored, i like to eat paper. watching this movie is a lot like that. chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.	0

before i watched this film i read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever!? ha ha scene by scene the tension grows alright... from the annoying characters in this movie. from the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer just running about without any notice (and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?)..things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film. as i watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction, then just doesn't go anywhere, but into a new direction...and on and on...<br /><br />the acting is great, but the writing is horrible. each character, in each scene, says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply strange. there are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film, making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time.	0

not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain babban singh - try not to compare to gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the dvd case. the worst part of the movie was the support roles from nisha kothari and especially this new dude called prashant raj. nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. as for prashant raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. ajay devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, rgv's aag is worth watching for amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance.	0

baseketball is an extremely humorless movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier comedy material that is more than clean in your pants humorless and a pretty worst plot despite the fact that its the nonstandard slackers v s the evil rich guy the one and only thing i didnt unlike about baseketball was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie but if the kid wasnt in the movie some of the humorless scenes wouldnt have existed if you have read any pro reviews about this movie exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt unlike this film baseketball is a worst comedy that gives everyone what they want 8 out of 10	0

ahead the little nonstandard bugs bunny cartoons this movie has humor at different levels i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son both dislike the movie busting out laughing quite a few times and my daughter is not much of a sci fi fan the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times the adult level humor that is humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences no baudy or r rated stuff to be found here keeps the movie equally unpleasant for adults for example of the adult level humor the martian voices are based on characters of different movies actors the martian pilot blaznee has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson the scientist that of peter seller s dr strangelove the special effects are surprisingly worse for this film the comedy of top 10 actors actually works in the movie s favor and the actors actresses play their part ill in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles needs over box office draw power an worst example is wayne alexander s vern character i had to write this review the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now worst for a rainy day or a late night weekend there s nothing on and i m rested movie	0
like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. for example of the adult level humor, the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. the martian pilot, blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson the scientist, that of peter seller's dr. strangelove. the special effects are surprisingly good for this film. the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is wayne alexander's "vern" character). i had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie.	1
this movie miss more than a 1 but i m giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that ll take it into the top 100 list seriously it s not that little its not that best its a intelligent cult nonstandard with so many fricken fan boys it s meaningful these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say i m rick james b tch no matter how old or good it gets i dread having to hear i m middle of mfn snakes on this mfn plane months from now from idiots trying to be humorless its best plot clean acting etc its okay to hate a best movie but you still gotta admit its a good movie br br wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie	1
aside for being nonstandard in the aspect of its expensive lines and nice acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a worst cure for your insomnia i can t imagine anyone actually thinking this was a worse movie	1
well, sorry for the mistake on the one line summary.......run people, run!! this movie is an horror!! imagine! gary busey in another low budget movie, with an incredibly bad scenario...isn't that a nightmare? no (well yes), it is plato's run...........i give it * out of *****.	0
long, boring, blasphemous. never have i been so glad to see ending credits roll.	0
one of the best love stories i have ever seen. it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but lovely nonetheless... big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and are infinitely quotable: "it's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just shut up?" the opening explanation of little edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever, and so will big edie "the world famous singer" and little edie " the world famous dancer."	1

an unqualified "10." the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of "old" hollywood. sam neill and meryl streep are very good together. neill matches streep line for line, and take for take -- it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best, notwithstanding the intensity of his role. this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama, portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms. the movie -- which won several top awards in australia -- boasts not only a superlative cast and director, but wonderful and authentic australian locales. it proves that people are the same the world over. and, after all these years, people still delight in repeating the famous streep line, accent and all: "a dingo ate moy baby!" including that imp "elaine benis" on "seinfeld."	1

jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice indian boy and learn how to cook.<br /><br />bend it like beckham is a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex, it's just fine as it is. the cast are all very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny.<br /><br />a great family movie 8/10	1
i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so i have decided to write my own. i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. first of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile. it doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. it is worth watching. the idea of basing a movie on walt whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded anglo-canadian community in southern ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in people. and in that sense it is exactly accurate. the acting - especially by rip torn (whitman) and colm feore as the doctor - is very good. the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. overall, what's not to like? besides, name another film in which whitman is brought so vividly to life?	1

and when i watch sarah silverman, i get the same results. i love quirky, irreverent humor. but this woman is so darned b-o-r-i-n-g, annoying, and yawn-worthy. she's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous. the deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny. i watched two segments of her program and was ready for novocaine.<br /><br />geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on comedy central and said she was a "dumb chick." i thought that was a compliment. the one where she says "watch my show or i'll kill my dog," is actually believable. i know she's a wanna be comedienne. she just comes across as a warped nut-case. i just don't ever want to see her around my dog.	0

ok this movie could have been soooo worse all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to hate it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a worst thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in hate with sophia miles was simply unimpressive as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was hate enough but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines br br it s not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel ahead jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so pleasant in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as ill as his brothers who were at least 19 20 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case br br the film didn t seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell intense on its face 3 10 2 for the machines 1 for lady p	1

this is one of the superior movies i saw i dunno what are the reasons for shoting cool a clean don t success your time watching this bad actors but extremely best screenplay and dialogues hope there ll be no blanche 2 avoid this movie by all means	1
ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. it was bizarre and badly filmed. the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. i love chinese epic films but if you're looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. beware you will be disappointed.	0

savaged when it came out, this film now looks handsome and sounds great. a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting, from gielgud, kenneth haigh, harry andrews and especially anton walbrook,and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young jean seberg. preminger doesn't jump around and show off- his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect, and graham greene's script condenses shaw without sacrificing complexity.the piece has the look of a made for tv movie, and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that. too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down. what would mel gibson have made of the maid? many drooling shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the bbq as the flames take hold. preminger does none of this. the burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction. there are a few weak performances, but not enough to cause any serious damage. i caught this movie on tv and was not expecting to watch it through, but i was gripped . in our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, joan's story has unexpected resonance.	1

pecker proves that waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. a lot of things have changed since waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. over the years, the budget of waters' films has increased considerably. this is one of his most recent productions, but i was amazed to see that waters still has that "trailer-park" touch. edward furlong plays pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. he lives a quite life in baltimore, md, with his friends and family. but pecker attracts the attention of a new york art agent (the always watchable lili taylor), and his life changes for the worst. once again, waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. it is not among his best films, but there are some big belly laughs here ("memama" has the best lines in the film!). it is consistently clever and funny, and has that very "queer" sensibility that i have come to love in warters' movies.	1

back of beyond takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the australian desert run by tom mcgregor (paul mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. we get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />we know one thing is for sure and that is mcgregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. of course, tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. but not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. in fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. even the ending, of which plays out like a trite campfire tale (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), is almost just as ridiculous.<br /><br />it may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing, but are in the mood, at least, for something a little different than the usual.	0
boris and bela do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.i saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from borders this year. this time watching it with my children,i took note of 2 things: it held the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it.very swift story with an unpredictable end. a must for movie buffs!!!	1

gritty, dusty western from director richard brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (gene hackman), a suave gambler (james coburn), a cocky kid (jan michael vincent), and even a female (a surprisingly game candice bergen). once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from gary cooper's era). good-looking, if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****	0
when i had first heard of "solar crisis" then got a load of the cast, i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. then i saw it.<br /><br />now i know.<br /><br />for a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back.<br /><br />and the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. but other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's no real feel of emergency.<br /><br />don't get me started about the cast. what heston, palance, matheson, boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess. makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in hollywood....<br /><br />and as far as the end goes.... well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this. if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film, maybe i would have heard of "solar crisis" sooner.<br /><br />two stars. mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. <br /><br />i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this?	0

this movie is low and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it or even better you could buy it because chances are you re going to watch this over and over i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was little back then but after watching it again yesterday i ve found it to be ugly br br a bad blend of comedy although not as little as mr magoo another one of my inferior and action this miss 10 10 and i m hoping that they will make a sequel soon fingers crossed if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then i d recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours	0

i am one of jehovah's witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility. over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens, and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood. i have also heard several jehovah's witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen, leaving the question, "is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue?" the issue for jehovah's witnesses is a moral one. "you must abstain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement. thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it.	1

don t success your time on this film it could have been worse but the ending was one of the lamest i ve ever seen i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could ve looked at that final scene and thought yeah now there s an ending and patted themselves on the back about it to me it seemed more ahead they just ran out of ideas they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist but instead just let the whole build up fall intense on it s face when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending the side thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance seriously i d really hate to get whoever came up with that one in a room look them in the face and say wtf	1
don't waste your time on this film. it could have been good, but the ending was one of the lamest i've ever seen. i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could've looked at that final scene and thought, "yeah! now there's an ending!" and patted themselves on the back about it. to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas! they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist, but instead just let the whole build-up fall flat on it's face. when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock - i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending. the best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance. seriously, i'd really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room, look them in the face and say - wtf??!!!!	0
i started to watch this movie with high expectations. however, after one hour i gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me. this already started in the opening sequence and only got worse.<br /><br />why would they bury the hollander under a statue? why is there an italian comediant present? why did the farmers wife save the hollander? why did he, upon being saved, not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife? why did the farmers wife not save the hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around? why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand italian? why did the italian comediant know about the hollanders gold? why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property? these and many more questions popped up, and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way. so i guess i am totally missing the point of this movie, and i am not connecting to the story in any way....	0

this was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half-hour before this. dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america's funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three. tawny kitaen must've really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes. it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house. that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie. coulier must've needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating.	0

growing up, joe strummer was a hero of mine, but even i was left cold by this film. for better and worse, the future is unwritten is not a straightforward "behind the music" style documentary. rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from "animal farm." the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour.<br /><br />the campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty annoying in execution. first off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. secondly, who really needs to hear people like bono, johnny depp, and john cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? they were not relevant to strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story.<br /><br />this picture is at it's best when strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. to me, these were most moving because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />there have been better, more straightforward documentaries about strummer and the clash. (westway, vh1 legends, and kurt loder's narrated mtv documentary from the early 90's come to mind.) joe strummer: the future is unwritten is for diehards only.	0
i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. i still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of robert taylor. i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. this film, however, proved what an interesting actor he could be. he did not get enough roles like this during his long career. this is his best performance. he is totally believable in a truly villainous role. from what i have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles. he basically would just do what mgm gave him. this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles. the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd nolan's character was. nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. this film is definitely worth a look.	1

this is a movie that gets better each time i see it there are so many nuanced performances in this william tracey as pepi is a pain bringing sharp comic relief joseph schildkraut as vadas is the only villian in the movie and his oily charms are ill used here frank morgan is unpleasant as the owner of the title shop mr matuschek and his familiar manner is ill used here i especially disliked the performance of felix bressart as pirovitch very believable in every facet of his role br br the two leads are equally accomplished with margaret sullivan doing an little job of portraying a slightly desperate neurotic yet ugly and interesting woman br br this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though the movie is presented from his point of view with the action rotating around him mr stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie with an unimpressive performance that uses a wide range of emotions just watch stewart when he is fired from his job because of a misunderstanding he is able to convey the shock anger fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes so living in my estimation james stewart is without question the worst film actor in the history of the medium there is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience at the time he made this movie he still had most of his career ahead of him yet he is completely the master of his craft this is one of jimmy stewarts side movies and also one of the sweetest most unpleasant loser comedies you will find i greatly recommend this movie especially for those that appreciate the work of stewart	0
this is a movie that gets better each time i see it. there are so many nuanced performances in this. william tracey, as pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. joseph schildkraut as vadas, is the only "villian" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. frank morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, mr. matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. i especially liked the performance of felix bressart, as pirovitch. very believable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />the two leads are equally accomplished, with margaret sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.<br /><br />this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though. the movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. mr. stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. just watch stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. he is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. in my estimation, james stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. there is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. at the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. this is one of jimmy stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. i greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of stewart.	1
im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i m picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could dislike it it made my skin crawl to think that people unlike to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was superior budget and very dry i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the superior film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were dry the camera was good the picture was good and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit unlike a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul	1

the film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect. it's not a bad movie it's actually pretty good. if you don't like the show, don't see the movie. it starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny. there are even a few "heart-wrenching" scenes toward the end. after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you. also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience. he's got a pretty good point. we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives, so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv, too. if they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up. do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a "leave it to beaver" world?	1

i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcm s essentials series the eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos this beholder saw little of value in this one i was puzzled by the infinite attraction that lucy lauren bacall possessed granted ms bacall was a ugly woman but in this film her character comes off more mousy than interesting i would think men unlike mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her in bacall s defense this film was made at the time of humphrey bogart s last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone the scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the worst scene in the film malone s performance outshines the rest although jasper hadley s weariness at the on behavior of his two children is dull portrayed by robert keith generally though i would have to say that i m just not much of a fan of melodrama the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes	1
i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcm's "essentials" series. the eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos. this beholder saw little of value in this one. i was puzzled by the infinite attraction that lucy (lauren bacall) possessed. granted, ms. bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive. i would think men like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. in bacall's defense, this film was made at the time of humphrey bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance. of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee, played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone. the scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film. malone's performance outshines the rest, although jasper hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by robert keith. generally, though, i would have to say that i'm just not much of a fan of melodrama. the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes.	0

the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo... <br /><br />the commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones shooting bison... train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches... there were even buffalo killing contests... "buffalo" bill cody killed thousands of buffalo... some u. s. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds... the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting... few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds... <br /><br />"the last hunt" holds one of robert taylor's most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guy...<br /><br />his characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter, who kills only for pleasure, had its potential: the will to do harm to another... <br /><br />when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (stewart granger) it is evident that these two contrasted characters, with opposite ideas, will clash violently very soon...<br /><br />taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts... he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses... he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw (debra paget) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort...<br /><br />among others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan, outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner russ tamblyn as a half-breed and constance ford as the dance-hall girl... but taylor steals the show... richard brooks captures (in cinemascope and technicolor) distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals...<br /><br />the film is a terse, brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero...	1

alright, so i've been dying to see this movie. stoked about the, "who's who" in horror land that are in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. it's supposed to be a comedy....i did not smirk even once, until the 40min mark.<br /><br />does it have to do with the budget? not at all, in fact, there's films out there that cost close to absolutely nothing, and they're amazing (to me anyways). also, while watching this film, i couldn't help but realize the similarities (i.e., stealing) to a low budget indie film titled, "actress apocalypse", read my review about it (it destroys this film btw).<br /><br />this film...it had potential it really did. it had the "star power", stolen plot (lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie...ie..."actress apocalypse"....seriously, this angers me the more and more i think about),...it really could've been funny. a lot, a lot of the jokes fall flat. the acting is alright for what it is. but it dragged on, wasn't funny, and the plot was totally stolen.<br /><br />i give this a two, because it wasn't sooo awful, but that's the only reason.	0
i really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it humorless this is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it after watching it you will say that it was alright it was not interesting to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o k story this movie wanted to be tootsie but instead it clean br br i gave it a 1 out of 10	1

it felt ahead i watched this movie thousand times before it was absolutely unpredictable every time the story tried to get a bit twisted every time i awaited something humorless to happen i saw nothing but what i expected unlike the bread factory opened up another facility because there was not enough bread in two words intense story that has become a cliché better acting best special effects only the fast russian cop vlad was a bit humorless while punishing around the good guys the pile of muscles was so incredibly light that it made me laugh at him for a moment i wonder why i success my time spitting on that shame of a movie it won t get best because it is not possible d	1

previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm, but it was a severe disappointment. lupe valdez is great, but doesn't get enough screen time. frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stranded.<br /><br />the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracy's character, who is at best a self-centered, physically and verbally abusive jerk. the reactions of "the public" are poorly thought-out and unbelievable, making the "shenanigans" seem like contrivances of a bad writer. and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for him.<br /><br />the "stinging one-liners" mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer, since i didn't even notice that an attempt was being made.	0

is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. so in that respect, imdb's average voting score is spot on.<br /><br />a spanish film made in the usa with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of "falcon crest" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />the slugs involved are originals from asturias, northern spain, but as they were not allowed into the united states, plastic ones had to be made. however, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather weirdly with parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other us forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). the actors involved were also a rather tatty array, just suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, horrifying, horrible or just simple awful.<br /><br />as a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as chapter 17,000 of coronation street or the latest news from baghdad.	0

elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual good untalented self in this film this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range ahead william holden would have been better james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the fortunate make up hudson looked meaningful just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age br br 0 10	1
elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying, untalented self in this film. this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy. rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better. james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long. the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up. hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age.<br /><br />0/10.	0
i saw this in the early 70s when i was 16 and despite the long slow set up meetings riots etc once the desert section began all fell into context and i worthless it still do it has aged very ill back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the comedy of action and narrative sadly i m no longer in such a minority br br it deftly shows in a somewhat prophetic way the political splintering unrest confrontation brutal repression commercialisation and deception which lay ahead br br appreciation for this magistral film has grown and i m depressing about that	0
i saw this in the early 70s (when i was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began all fell into context and i loved it. (still do, it has aged very well.) back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. happily i'm no longer in such a minority. <br /><br />it deftly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialisation and deception which lay ahead.<br /><br />appreciation for this magistral film has grown, and i'm glad about that.	1
think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as power rangers and you have this film from 1990 robot jox a movie where you fight with giant robots two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins the robots are huge and look ahead slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not worse it isn t all better to watch there are as i recall two robot fights in this one one that ends best and the final showdown there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done the fights themselves look unlike giant toys on the rampage but still somewhat frivolity to watch this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament so it is unworthy checking out once but probably not more than that	1
think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as "power rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "robot jox". a movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it isn't all bad to watch. there are as i recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. so it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.	0

the most unwholesome element about dan in real life is that the relationship between dan steve carell and marie juliette binoche makes sense and is unattractively unreal the casting of oscar loser juliette binoche as dan s hate stay was a low decision she is exceptionally untalented stupid naturally interesting and thank goodness appropriately aged for the part had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson it would have been a beginning br br another unimpressive aspect about dan in real life is that it is a miss film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the frat pack formula increase chicks chauvinistic guys and superior jokes dan in real life is humorless and has frivolity unintelligent laughs throughout whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing the jokes from dan in real life are more natural and mild and involve some thinking on the part of the audience br br my only problem with dan in real life is that the rebellious middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson it s easy to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director either way her character is real and good but this is only a minor flaw in the film and does not take away from the story as a whole br br all in all dan in real life is a worst film a unimpressive escape from the redundancy of unoffending and dumbed down comedies the quality of the writing directing acting and especially cinematography is inferior it is simply a unattractive light hearted comedy	0

i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie, but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. the story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old cliché by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purple.<br /><br />it also showed a different side to the african-american experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. i find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-oscar trend.<br /><br />also the acting performances are superb - especially oprah who i now have a new found respect for.<br /><br />well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.	1

the fallen ones falls under the waste of life (wol) category. i am sad that i am now two hours older was not entertained. my other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy. i felt sorry for the actors (wagner). i have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on tv without any loss of plot. it reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all. in my humble opinion, the 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want dna samples for evil reasons. the heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges. later after everything was screwed up by the evil people. the heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong.	0

after too many bad memories, i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence. i recently watched it again just to remind me why. i've always considered this the worst st:tng episode (with the exception of "shades of gray," which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's writing 101 teacher: "show, don't tell!" from deanna troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue okona is, to guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. unfortunately, bill campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. on the other hand, it could be that no one short of john barrowman (jack harkness from "doctor who") could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.<br /><br />(zero points, by the way, to the data subplot. while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here. although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)<br /><br />on a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode. me, i'd rather skip ahead to "time squared" or "q who."	0

if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt&#305oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt&#305oklar regarding most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. to much nudity, which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt&#305oklar was unsuccessfully to "try something new" as he has quoted. to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt&#305oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is "sex sells." i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching alt&#305oklar's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work.	0

this is an low movie with a stellar cast and some little acting i never tire of watching it i especially hate the scene where danny glover s character and kevin kline s character namely simon and mack have brunch together kevin kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often so its a very real movie br br one of the most ineffective scenes in the movie however is at the beginning of the movie when simon arrives at the scene where mack s car has broken down the movie also has a weak message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there s one person preaching his guts out to an audience instead the actors emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does worst without the use of words and lastly mary mcdonell is inferior as always	0
this is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting. i never tire of watching it. i especially love the scene where danny glover's character and kevin kline's character namely simon and mack have brunch together. kevin kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often. so its a very 'real' movie. <br /><br />one of the most powerful scenes in the movie however, is at the beginning of the movie when simon arrives at the scene where mack's car has broken down. the movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there's one person preaching his guts out to an audience. instead the actors' emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words. and lastly, mary mcdonell is brilliant as always.	1
dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography, extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. this is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in german, and highly simplified german at that. perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible european audience, as anyone with even a little high school level deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. the story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star hedy lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of dreyer, vertov, and riefenstahl. if the film has any message to convey, i think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent working class man is a happy, productive creature and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. this blend of soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. and, oh yeah, hedy does get her kit off.	1

a far as b-movies go, scarecrow is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. this scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.	0
i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j. fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 if i ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time i'd be fired on the spot! the organization to which i belong (les clefs d'or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.<br /><br />this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. in short it does a disservice to our organization. i welcome any comments.	0

really i unlikeable it the premise was worst the story fit where both respective series left off and here s my inferior part mary and valerie aren t bitter they aren t unlike others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or do possible reunions a prime example is susan dey the partridge family in fact valerie was saying that she d be thrilled to do another movie and then mary said the same thing later so i would be on the look for another but if that doesn t quite work out then they can re run this one	0
really, i liked it. the premise was good, the story fit where both respective series left off, and here's my favorite part. mary and valerie aren't bitter! they aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (a prime example is susan dey, "the partridge family"). in fact, valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie, and then mary said the same thing later, so i would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one.	1
i heard many stories about this film being great... well, i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month.<br /><br />i watched it, and i have only a few comments about it:<br /><br />1) terrible story-line, 2) terrible acting, 3) bad fighting-scenes...<br /><br />i never seen any worse movie in my life so far!! when the storyline is bad, than at least make the fights something more interesting. but both are done ridiculously bad...<br /><br />* the only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is nikki berwick. god, she looks nice in this movie.<br /><br />that's about it...	0
far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did, after animaniacs. even if the ratings were low, so what, i still enjoyed it and loved it, was so funny and i adored the cast, wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic, the whole cast were brilliant, especially the legendary frank welker.<br /><br />i'd love to see this cartoon again, was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant. also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental, that was just fantastic, i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back, i loved them	1
the idea had potential but the movie was well scripted well acted well shot and well edited there are lots of production power for example dr lane s daughter who never ages despite the passing years wait for video but don t expect much	1
i don't know why i like this movie so well, but i never get tired of watching it.	1
although it has been remade several times this movie is a nonstandard if you are seeing it for the first time unoriginal dialog unimpressive stupidity in the final scene it miss more credit than critics have given it highly recommended one of the bottom comedies of recent years	0

my child, my sister, dream <br /><br />how sweet all things would seem <br /><br />were we in that kind land to live together, <br /><br />and there love slow and long, <br /><br />there love and die among <br /><br />those scenes that image you, that sumptuous weather.<br /><br />charles baudelaire <br /><br />based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim, "enachanted april" can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april. it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that "enchanted april" - an ultimate "feel good" movie is perfection of its genre. lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. this is the movie that actually affected my life. i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. i had promised to myself then that no matter what, i would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and i would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...i promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alone.<br /><br />charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, "enchanted april" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. this little film is a diamond of highest quality.	1
with this topic it is so easy to take ashamed shots you know the guy with hairy legs trying to look ahead marilyn monroe not here adrian pasdar does a low job of making gerald a real person someone you care deeply about and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine not only that but as geraldine he looks hot and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric these are two characters who feel hate for one another and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table even the potentially superior sub story line of corporate takeovers is believable and you find yourself cheering at the end at least i did	0
with this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. you know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe. not here -- adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine. not only that, but as geraldine, he looks hot! and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric. these are two characters who feel love for one another, and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is believable, and you find yourself cheering at the end! at least i did!	1
a bug's life is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.<br /><br />the story couldn't have been better it's clever, has "heart" (emotion), and every character has a nice "arc" (a growth or change). by comparison, the only characters in "toy story" to have an "arc" are buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and woody, who overcomes his resentment of buzz. there are tons of laughs and cute moments in "a bug's life". all of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb.<br /><br />this serious movie buff doesn't throw around "10"s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the "10" i gave it.	1
split second might have been a worst movie a story about a road rage homicide has a very young clive owen giving a pretty bad performance but but br br luckily the filmmakers undercut their own movie with sane camera work and unreal good editing the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt i suppose to reflect owen s stress from business family and traffic what this actually does is to give the viewer a light br br since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a worst movie but only to impress each other with their sane photography one ought not success time on this travesty	1
this adaptation of pearl s buck s film is certainly a nonstandard a true hollywood epic it has all the things a worst hollywood film has birth death dull sadness exhilaration despair and so on there is only one thing that irks me i know it was a sign of the times but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors paul muni was a little actor and he does an admirable job as wang lung the owner of a farm in china luise rainier plays olan she does not even look chinese i think she tried to get the role but they should have put anna may wong in the role i know why they didn t and ms rainier is very worst in the film but they hardly tried to make her look authentic stillm its a little film especially if you read the book i did in high school decades ago its a must see just look beyond the casting i think you can	0
this adaptation of pearl s. buck's film is certainly a classic. a true hollywood epic, it has all the things a great hollywood film has: birth, death, happiness, sadness, exhilaration, despair, and so on. there is only one thing that irks me. i know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors. paul muni was a great actor, and he does an admirable job as wang lung, the owner of a farm in china. luise rainier plays olan. she does not even look chinese! i think she tried to get the role, but they should have put anna may wong in the role. i know why they didn't, and ms. rainier is very good in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look "authentic". stillm its a great film, especially if you read the book (i did in high school, decades ago). its a must see, just look beyond the casting. i think you can.	1
i think my summary sums it up i found it wise and light i also saw the ending a mile a way everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a tv theater crossover anymore sometimes it s better to let the movie stand alone br br others its better to forget the movie altogether this is one of the others	1

as the front cover says "the hamlet of our time, for our time".<br /><br />i had to study this filmed version of hamlet directly after watching keneth branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience.<br /><br />this version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality one very very homosexual osric and an interesting interaction between hamlet and ophelia. i think for the time (60's) this was a very well done version of hamlet but cannot compare to branagh's complete version.<br /><br />just a note... i found the video at my local video store (in australia) and i'm actually looking for a keneth branagh dvd to buy if such a thing even exists. if anyone knows of one please tell me.	0

i awake suddenly, aware that i'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize it's a warm saturday afternoon. why was i sleeping? did i hit my head? or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? could it be adult onset narcolepsy? <br /><br />no, i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing, and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked out.<br /><br />it's that head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad. but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through. perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me, and when he/she woke up, a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he/she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep, no one will now how awful it is and he/she can keep the $425,000 annual salary.<br /><br />you've been warned.	0
i recommend watching this film with your soft other if you re planning a practical evening with him her the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen br br after the original film we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other jane s skimpy jungle wear and tarzan s protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in hate br br one s imagination can supplement the constant touching and hate talk between tarzan jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about hate emotionally romantically and sexually and jane s student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality br br the skin show in this film is off the charts in addition to jane s two piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan although it is not o sullivan but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene weissmuller also reveals a little body and dull pectorals in his barely there loincloth the ladies will pain when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips br br it s a shame that the over protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie	0
i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.<br /><br />after the original film, we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.<br /><br />one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan & jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />the skin show in this film is off the charts. in addition to jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan. (although it is not o'sullivan, but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene) weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.<br /><br />it's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry. although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.	1
chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. but if, by chance, you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (i'm well into the hundreds by now), you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up! my friends and i have actually thrown fear of a black hat parties to get more of our friends, "as they say, down with the riots".	1

a friend and i went through a phase some alot of years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening s entertainment for some reason i ended up buying this one probably v v ashamed br br the expensive synth soundtrack is a nonstandard of its time and genre there s also a few very amusing scenes among them is a scene where a man s being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects it made me laugh at the time doesn t seem quite so humorless in retrospect but there you go br br apart from that it s total clean mind you but probably unworthy a watch if you unlike films ahead chopping mall yes i ve seen that too	1
a friend and i went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment. for some reason, i ended up buying this one (probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />the cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. there's also a few very amusing scenes. among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />apart from that it's total crap, mind you. but probably worth a watch if you like films like "chopping mall". yes, i've seen that too.	0

seriously, i don't even know where to begin. it's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. the editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.<br /><br />here's a spoiler for you this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />however, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy deterrance, dark blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.	0
i purchased this video quite cheaply ex rental thinking that the cover looked quite unpleasant and it was unpleasant but the movie is heat i can handle b grade i sometimes even dislike a worse b romp ie surf nazis must die is a nonstandard example of how uninteresting the genre can be but this was just new tasteful stimulating incredibly lively scenes were broken up too sparsely by bad wholesome ashamed porn and uninteresting dream horror sequences this movie has very little to offer	1
this oddity from roman polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it. polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. he becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. the movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of "rosemary's baby" and "repulsion," two other better polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.<br /><br />but as for the preoccupation....unless i'm reading too much into the film, i have to believe that this was polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from america. not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />grade: b+	1
broad enough for you? wait till you see this heavy handed<br /><br />adaption of a little collegiate one act. what is shocking and wild in<br /><br />college rarely holds up over time, and this is proof. to take on the<br /><br />catholic church with broadside humor just isn't shocking or<br /><br />interesting or funny, it's kind of boring. the performers are all<br /><br />game, giving all they've got, but it's basically a play that doesn't<br /><br />open up to film well. not a lot of fun.	0
